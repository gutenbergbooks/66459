<h2 class="nobreak lsp" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the “London Gazette,” from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign’s
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty’s special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General’s Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
“firm as the rocks of their native shore:” and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar’s favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar’s legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were “<em>men-at-arms</em>,” and sixty “<em>shot</em>;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
“grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years’ War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an array of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years’ war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years’ war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troop in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world, where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

the successes which have attended the exertions of his troops in Egypt to
that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but His Majesty
desires it may be most solemnly and forcibly impressed on the consideration
of every port of the army, that it has been a strict observance of order, discipline,
and military system, which has given the full energy to the
native valour of the troops, and hue enabled them proudly to assert the
superiority of the national military character, in situations uncommonly
arduous, and under circumstances of peculiar difficulty.”&mdash;<em>General

<p>In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards

of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January, 1809, it is stated:&mdash;“On
no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught,
that whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstance can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>At the commencement of the eighteenth century,
the British monarch witnessed his efforts to curb the
ambition of Louis XIV., and to preserve the balance of
power in Europe, counteracted by the virtual union of
two powerful states, under a dynasty distinguished for
its thirst for conquest, the King of France having procured
the accession of his grandson, Philip, Duke of
Anjou, to the throne of Spain. Existing treaties were
thus openly violated; at the same time the liberties of
Europe were invaded by the seizure of the Spanish
Netherlands, by the troops of France, and the detention
of the Dutch garrisons in the barrier towns; and war was
resolved upon. A considerable augmentation was made
to the British army, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth Regiment
of Foot</span> is one of the corps embodied on this
occasion. Its first colonel was <span class="smcap">Robert Lord Lucas</span>,
from the lieutenant-colonelcy of Sir John Jacob’s Regiment,
now Thirteenth Light Infantry, his commission
bearing date the 12th of February, 1702.</p>

<p>This regiment was composed of men from Norfolk,
Essex, and the adjoining counties, and was raised under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the authority of warrants from King William III., by
Colonel Lord Lucas, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Dare,
Major Garth, Captains Kitson, Edward Shadwell, E.
Parsons, P. Lechire, &mdash;&mdash; Pardon, Richard Steele, and
Robert Cecill, who each raised a company; and when
the numbers were nearly complete, the establishment
was augmented to twelve companies, of three officers
and sixty-six non-commissioned officers and soldiers
each: one wing of the regiment had its rendezvous at
Colchester, and the other at Norwich.</p>

<p>While the regiment was completing its ranks, the
death of King William III., and the accession of Queen
Anne, occurred on the 8th of March, 1702, and the
soldiers took the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty.</p>

<p>An expedition being fitted out against Cadiz, under
the Duke of Ormond, <span class="smcap">Lord Lucas’s</span> Regiment was
ordered to send five companies to Landguard Fort,
Sheerness, and Tilbury, early in May, to relieve the
Buffs, who were ordered to embark on board of frigates
for the Isle of Wight, to join the expedition to Spain;
at the same time seven companies of <span class="smcap">Lord Lucas’s</span>
Regiment were ordered to relieve a detachment of the
Foot Guards on duty at the Tower of London, of which
fortress his Lordship was lieutenant-governor; two
companies were afterwards detached to Dover Castle.</p>

<p>On the return of the expedition from Spain, the
regiment was relieved from duty at the out-stations, and
was quartered in the Tower, from whence it detached
three hundred men to the West Indies, to complete
Colonel Columbine’s Regiment, now Sixth Foot,
which was ordered to proceed to that station. After
the departure of this detachment, the regiment proceeded,
in December, into Essex to recruit, the head-quarters
being established at Chelmsford.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1703<br />1704</div>

<p>The ranks of the regiment were speedily completed,
and in the spring of 1703 it marched to Hull, Berwick,
and Carlisle; where it was stationed in the following year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>On the 31st of January, 1705, Colonel Lord Lucas
died; and was succeeded in the colonelcy of the regiment
by Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Hamilton, from the
Earl of Derby’s Regiment, now the Sixteenth Foot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the war which commenced on the
frontiers of the Netherlands, in 1702, had taken a
wider range, and Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Spain,
had become the theatre of conflict; and in May, the
regiment embarked on board the fleet under Sir
Cloudesly Shovel, with other forces commanded by
General the Earl of Peterborough, either to aid the
Duke of Savoy in driving the French out of Italy, to
make an attempt on Naples and Sicily, or to effect a
landing on the coast of Spain, as should appear most
for the interest of Her Majesty’s service. The fleet
arrived at Lisbon in June, and additional forces were
put on board; Archduke Charles, who was acknowledged
as King of Spain, also embarked, and an attempt
on the coast of Catalonia was resolved upon. From
Lisbon the armament sailed, on the 28th of July, for
Gibraltar, where a reinforcement joined from the garrison,
and Colonel Hans Hamilton, of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment, was nominated quartermaster-general
of the expedition.</p>

<p>Leaving Gibraltar, the fleet proceeded to the Bay of
Altea, in Valencia, and a number of Catalonians and
Valencians throwing off their allegiance to the House of
Bourbon, and acknowledging Archduke Charles as king
of Spain, the British general was induced to undertake
the siege of <em>Barcelona</em>, the capital of Catalonia, which
was defended by upwards of five thousand men, under
the viceroy of Catalonia, Don Francis Velasco. In
1697, this fortress resisted thirty thousand French
troops eight weeks, and cost Louis XIV. twelve
thousand men; but the Earl of Peterborough was
unable to bring more than seven thousand men into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the lines, which gave an interesting character to the
enterprise.</p>

<p>Landing near the river Bassoz, on the 23rd and
24th of August, the troops advanced towards the town,
and after some difficulties were overcome, the siege was
commenced. The native energy of British soldiers was
conspicuously displayed on this occasion, and the
grenadiers of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> had the honor to
take part in storming the detached fortress of <em>Montjuich</em>,
situate on a hill on the west side of the town. The
troops engaged on this service made a detour through
the mountains during the night of the 13th of September,
and stormed the outworks early on the following
morning, making a lodgment, gaining the bulwark
of a new fortification, and establishing themselves in
the works. In a few days afterwards the garrison
surrendered.</p>

<p>This success facilitated the siege of the city of
Barcelona, in which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment
took an active part. The armed Catalonian and Valencian
peasantry blocked up the avenues of the town;
seamen were landed from the fleet to take part in the
siege; the soldiers were incessant in their exertions;
cannon and mortars were dragged up steep precipices
by men; and a practicable breach being effected, a
detachment of the regiment was in readiness to take
part in storming the town; but the garrison surrendered,
and saved the effusion of blood which would
have attended this enterprise. A number of armed
countrymen entered the city through the breach, to
plunder the partisans of the house of Bourbon; but the
Earl of Peterborough entered the town at the head
of a troop of dragoons, and the grenadiers of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, and other regiments, put a stop to
the plundering, and rescued the governor and his
garrison from the vengeance of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>The capture of Barcelona produced great astonishment
throughout Europe, and the splendour of the
achievement augmented the reputation of the British
arms.</p>

<p>This success was followed by the submission of all
the province of Catalonia, and part of that of Valencia;
and after a short stay at Barcelona, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment was selected to form part of the
garrison of the ancient town of Tortosa, situated in a
pleasant fertile country, on the left bank of the Ebro,
near its influx into the sea. At this town, which was
called Dordosa by the Romans, and received municipal
privileges from Scipio, the regiment was stationed some
time: its services are consequently not immediately
connected with the exploits of the Earl of Peterborough
in Valencia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>As the operations of the British troops became
extended, the regiment quitted its pleasant quarters at
Tortosa, and was employed in several movements in
the early part of 1706.</p>

<p>King Charles and his counsellors did not make
efforts to provide for the defence of the towns which
had been gained, nor to obtain the means for future
conquests; but spent their time and money in diversions:
the breaches of <em>Barcelona</em> and Montjuich were
not repaired, and the garrison was unprovided for a siege.
King Philip pursued a different line of conduct; he
collected forces from various quarters, and assembled a
numerous army, with a powerful artillery, for the re-capture
of the provinces he had lost, and a formidable
French and Spanish force approached the capital of
Catalonia by land; at the same time a French fleet
appeared before the city. The garrison being weak in
numbers, corps were hurried from various places to
increase its strength; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment
travelled one hundred and twenty miles on mules,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
on the 30th and 31st of March, and on the 1st of April
mounted guard on the works. The regiment had not
been two hours on duty when the French approached
the place, and made an attack on the outworks of fort
Montjuich; but were repulsed by a hundred men of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, in gallant style<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. To the timely
arrival of the regiment may be attributed, in a great
measure, the preservation of the town: the soldiers
repaired the breaches, and made a desperate and resolute
defence.</p>

<p>King Charles remained in Barcelona; his presence
stimulated the garrison to extraordinary efforts, and
British valour was conspicuously displayed in his cause;
but the troops were not sufficiently numerous for the
defence of so extensive a place. When the garrison,
bravely struggling against multiplied difficulties, had
become exhausted; its numbers decreased by deaths,
wounds, and sickness to about a thousand men, and a
practical breach was ready for the enemy to attack the
place by storm, the combined English and Dutch fleets
approached with reinforcements; the French naval
force hurried from before the town, and the garrison
was relieved. Losing all hope of final success, and
having had five thousand men killed and wounded
before the town, the enemy made a precipitate retreat
on the 12th of May, leaving two hundred brass cannon,
thirty mortars, and immense stores of ammunition and
provision, together with the sick and wounded of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
army, behind them, and hurrying to France, they thus
left the allies at liberty to engage in new enterprises.
Barcelona was thus preserved by British skill and
valour; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment received,
with the other corps in garrison, the thanks of King
Charles for its heroic conduct. Its numbers were considerably
reduced by casualties during the siege.</p>

<p>An immediate advance on Madrid was resolved
upon; and the allied army on the frontiers of Portugal
was requested to penetrate boldly to the capital of
Spain. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment embarked for
Valencia to join in this enterprise; and, after landing,
it furnished a number of select men towards completing
the Earl of Peterborough’s Regiment of Dragoons,
which was embodied on this occasion. The advance to
Madrid was delayed; pernicious councils, which paid
more attention to court formalities than to military
operations, retarded the journey of King Charles. This
gave time for the French forces to re-enter Spain, and
for the arrival of additional troops to reinforce the
enemy; and the allied army, after advancing to Madrid,
was obliged to retreat to Valencia and Murcia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>After passing the winter in Spain, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment, being much reduced in numbers,
was directed to transfer its private soldiers fit for duty
to other corps, in the spring of 1707, and to return to
England to recruit. This took place before the army
took the field; and while the officers and non-commissioned
officers were waiting for transports, the battle of
Almanza was fought, on the 25th of April, when the
enemy gained a decisive victory. The embarkation was
afterwards delayed a short period; but in the autumn
the regiment arrived in England, and commenced recruiting
its ranks, in which it had great success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed in the south of England
in the spring of 1708, when the King of France fitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
out a fleet, and embarked troops, for the invasion of
Scotland, in favour of the Pretender. On this occasion
the regiment had so far recruited its numbers, and
become efficient, that it was selected to proceed to the
north, to confront the invaders; but it was ordered to
halt at Leeds, in consequence of the French shipping
having been chased from the British shores by the
English fleet.</p>

<p>Having defeated the enemy’s designs of invading
the United Kingdom, the British Government fitted out
an armament against the French coast, and the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Foot were ordered to return from
Yorkshire to take part in the enterprise. They proceeded
to the Isle of Wight, where they were reviewed
by Major-General Erle, on the 19th of July, and afterwards
embarked on board the fleet, under Admiral Sir
George Byng. The expedition approached the coast
of France in the early part of August, and after menacing
several places, a landing was effected to create
alarm, and make a diversion in favour of the allied army
in Flanders. The troops subsequently returned on
board the fleet, and, after menacing the coast at several
points, withdrew towards England. Orders were
afterwards received to proceed to Ostend, where the
several regiments arrived on the 21st of September;
when a body of French troops, under Count de la
Motte, who was advancing to surprise the town, made a
precipitate retreat towards Bruges, cutting the dikes to
lay the country between Ostend and Nieuport under
water. Major-General Erle landed with the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
and other regiments, and taking post at the
village of Leffinghen, formed an intrenched position.</p>

<p>At this period the allied army in the Netherlands
was engaged in the siege of the important fortress of
<em>Lisle</em>, and ammunition becoming scarce, the Duke of
Marlborough sent seven hundred waggons, under a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
strong guard, to Ostend, for a supply. Major-General
Erle had drained the inundations, built a bridge over
the canal at Leffinghen, and opened a communication
with the army, towards which the waggons laden with
stores began their march on the 26th of September;
and the guard having repulsed the forces under Count
de la Motte, at Wynendale, the convoy arrived safe at
its destination, and the army was enabled to continue
the siege.</p>

<p>The French commanders resolved to cut off the
communication of the allied army with Ostend, and the
Duke of Vendosme proceeded to Oudenburg with thirty
thousand men, established posts along the canal between
Plassendale and Nieuport, cut the dikes in several
places, and laid a great extent of country under water.
The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> and other regiments, under
Major-General Erle, pitched their tents on the high
grounds of Raversein, and the Duke of Marlborough
put the covering army in motion; when the Duke of
Vendosme made a precipitate retreat, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Foot took part in forwarding a supply of
ammunition across the inundations in boats. The
Duke of Vendosme detached a body of troops to
besiege Leffinghen, which was taken after a sharp
resistance. He also menaced the camp at Raversein,
when Major-General Erle retreated to the outworks of
Ostend.</p>

<p>A numerous body of the enemy marching to Brabant,
under the Elector of Bavaria, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>,
and four other regiments, embarked from
Ostend, under Brigadier-General Wynne, for Antwerp,
where they were stationed when the citadel of Lisle
surrendered, and the campaign was terminated by the
re-capture of Ghent and Bruges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment, being composed of
young soldiers, was employed on garrison duty during
the year 1709.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>In April, 1710, the regiment quitted its quarters,
and traversed the country towards the frontiers of
France, to serve the campaign of that year with the
army under the celebrated Duke of Marlborough. The
regiment was engaged in the operations by which the
French lines were passed at <em>Pont-a-Vendin</em>, and it
afterwards took part in the siege of the strong fortress
of <em>Douay</em>, where it had repeated opportunities of distinguishing
itself. This fortress was defended by a
numerous garrison, under General Albergotti, an officer
of reputation, who made a determined resistance; and
the soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment were
fully employed on duty in the trenches, carrying on the
approaches, repulsing the sallies of the garrison, and
storming the outworks, which occasioned considerable
loss. The French army advanced to raise the siege,
but did not hazard a general engagement; and Douay
surrendered on the 27th of June. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment had one subaltern, six serjeants, and
seventy-five rank and file killed; two captains, three
subalterns, five serjeants, and one hundred and twenty
rank and file wounded, during the siege<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>After the capture of this fortress, the regiment
joined the main army, which was encamped at Villers-Brulin
during the siege of <em>Bethune</em>, which fortress was
reduced before the end of August. The regiment was
subsequently employed in covering the sieges of <em>Aire</em>
and <em>St. Venant</em>, both of which fortresses were captured
before the end of the campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>Quitting its winter quarters among the Walloon
peasantry, in April, 1711, the regiment joined the
army, and was reviewed, at the camp at Warde, on the
8th of June, by the Duke of Marlborough. It was
formed in brigade with the Tenth, Twenty-first, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Wynne’s (afterwards disbanded) Regiment, under Brigadier-General
Hamilton, and took part in the
movements by which the enemy’s formidable lines
were passed at <em>Arleux</em>, on which occasion the superiority
of the English general’s tactics was particularly
conspicuous.</p>

<p>This splendid success was followed by the siege of
the town of <em>Bouchain</em>, situated on both sides of the river
Scheldt, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment had the
honor to take an active share in the operations against
this fortress, which was taken by capitulation in the
middle of September. When the damaged works at
Bouchain were repaired, the regiment went into winter
quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>Early in April, 1712, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment
took the field, and joined the army under the
command of the Duke of Ormond, who penetrated the
French territory to the frontiers of Picardy, encamping
at Cateau-Cambresis, while the Germans undertook the
siege of <em>Quesnoy</em>. In the mean time the French
monarch had solicited peace, and had agreed to deliver
the city of Dunkirk into the hands of the British sovereign,
as a pledge of his sincerity. A suspension of
arms was proclaimed between the British and French,
and the army under the Duke of Ormond withdrew to
Ghent. On the 4th of August the regiment was detached
from the camp near Ghent, with several other
corps, under Lieutenant-General the Earl of Orkney, to
Dunkirk, where it was stationed some time.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, 1712, Queen Anne conferred
the colonelcy of the regiment on Lieutenant-Colonel
Thomas Chudleigh, from Brigadier-General
Durell’s regiment, in succession to Brigadier-General
Hamilton, who, on the death of Brigadier-General
Durell, in December following, was nominated colonel
of his corps,&mdash;the Sixteenth Foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>At the conclusion of the peace of Utrecht, the regiment
was withdrawn from Dunkirk, and proceeded to
Great Britain. At this period a considerable reduction
took place in the numbers of the regular army, and all
the corps raised after the peace of Ryswick, in 1697,
were directed to be taken off the establishment, except
two, viz., the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Regiments
of Foot. This reduction included the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment, which was accordingly reduced, and
the officers placed upon half-pay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714<br />1715</div>

<p>The decease of Queen Anne, and the accession of
King George I., on the 1st of August, 1714, was followed
by a short period of tranquillity; but in 1715
the partisans of the Pretender made efforts to procure
his accession to the throne, and commotions occurred
in England; at the same time the nation was threatened
with invasion from abroad. The King augmented
the army, and warrants were issued for the
restoration of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> and several other
regiments of foot, in the summer of this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>Soon afterwards the standard of the Pretender was
raised in Scotland, by the Earl of Mar; but the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment was retained in England;
and the rebellion was suppressed in the early part of
1716, by the troops under the Duke of Argyle.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1717</div>

<p>In 1717, the regiment received orders to proceed to
Ireland, to relieve one of the corps ordered to be disbanded
in that country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1718<br />1719</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Ireland until the early
part of 1719, when the preparations made by the King
of Spain to forward the interests of the Pretender,
occasioned it to be withdrawn from that country; and it
was subsequently encamped in the Isle of Wight, and
held in readiness for active service. The British Government
projected the capture of Corunna, in Biscay,
and of Peru, in South America; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
sailed in the early part of September with the
expedition, under General Viscount Cobham, for the
attack of the former place; but on arriving off the
coast of Gallicia, circumstances occurred which occasioned
an attack on <em>Vigo</em> to be resolved upon. The
fleet entered the harbour of Vigo on the 29th of September,
seized on seven Spanish ships, and on the
following day the troops landed under the fire of
musketry from the mountains. Advancing towards the
town, the British forced the Spaniards to abandon Vigo
and Fort St. Sebastian, which were taken possession of
by eight hundred men, under Brigadier-General Honeywood.
A battery being opened against the citadel, the
garrison was soon induced to surrender, giving up two
thousand barrels of powder, eight thousand muskets,
and fifteen pieces of brass artillery, which had been prepared
for the invasion of Britain in favour of the
Pretender. While the siege of the castle of Vigo was
in progress, <em>Rondondella</em> was captured by a detachment
from the army; and on the 12th of October a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
men proceeded, under Major-General Wade, against
<em>Pont-a-Vedra</em>, from whence thirteen companies of
Spaniards fled in a panic; the town, arsenal, barracks
for two thousand men, thirteen pieces of brass and
eighty-six of iron ordnance, five thousand small arms,
three hundred barrels of powder, and a great quantity
of other stores, were captured. The arsenal, barracks,
and Fort Marine, were destroyed; the iron ordnance
and the more valuable stores were removed on board
the fleet.</p>

<p>Finding himself oppressed on every side, and his
resources exhausted, the King of Spain made pacific
overtures; and a treaty of peace was concluded before
the expedition to Peru was undertaken. The armament
returned to England, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
were again stationed in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1723</div>

<p>On the 18th of February, 1723, Lieutenant-Colonel
Robert Hayes, from the command of a company in the
First Foot Guards, was appointed colonel of the regiment,
by purchase, in succession to Colonel Chudleigh,
who retired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1726</div>

<p>Few years elapsed before the Spanish monarch
again violated the peace of Europe. The possessions,
of which he was deprived by the peace of Utrecht, in
1713, had been relinquished with reluctance, and
towards the end of 1726, he assembled an army in
Andalusia, under the command of the Count de la
Torres, to make a determined effort for the re-capture
of <em>Gibraltar</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727</div>

<p>In February, 1727, the garrison of Gibraltar opened
its fire on the besieging army; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment was, at this period, on its way from Ireland,
to share in the honor of a successful defence of this
important fortress. The regiment encountered a storm
at sea, and lost several companies by shipwreck; six
companies proceeded to Plymouth, and afterwards continuing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
their voyage, arrived at Gibraltar on the 26th
of March, in company with the Twenty-fifth Regiment;
they were followed by several other corps. The garrison
made a very gallant defence of the fortress committed
to their charge, against the storm of war, which
raged against them with increasing fury until the
thunder of one hundred cannon became almost incessant
in the day time, and was partially continued
throughout the night. The tremendous fire of the
Spaniards produced little effect beyond the bursting of
many of their own cannon, and rendering others useless;
and many thousands of the besieging army perished in
the attempt. In the early part of June, the fire
slackened; on the 18th of that month hostilities ceased;
and the fortress of Gibraltar continued to form one of
the trophies of British prowess.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1728</div>

<p>Peace having been concluded with Spain, the regiment
was withdrawn from Gibraltar, and proceeded to
Ireland, where it was conspicuous for its good conduct
in quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1731<br />1732</div>

<p>Colonel Robert Hayes died at Jamaica, on the 7th
of April, 1731, and the colonelcy of the regiment
remained vacant until the 8th of January 1732, when
King George II. conferred the appointment on Lieutenant-Colonel
Stephen Cornwallis, from the command
of a company in the Foot Guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1738</div>

<p>Colonel Cornwallis commanded the regiment until
1738, when he was removed to the Eleventh Foot, and
was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel Lord James
Cavendish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739</div>

<p>On the commencement of the war with Spain, in
1739, the establishment of the regiment was augmented,
and in the autumn it was removed to England.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1740</div>

<p>In 1740, a detachment of the regiment served on
board the fleet, as marines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741<br />1742</div>

<p>Colonel Lord James Cavendish died in November,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
1741, and in 1742 the colonelcy of the regiment was
conferred on Colonel the Honorable James Cholmondeley,
from the Fifty-ninth, now Forty-eighth Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743<br />1744</div>

<p>During the summer of this year a British army
proceeded to Flanders, to support the house of Austria,
against the united efforts of the King of France and the
Elector of Bavaria, who were endeavouring to deprive
the Archduchess, Maria Theresa, of her hereditary
dominions. In 1743, a victory was gained at Dettingen;
and in the summer of 1744, the allied army
confronted the forces of France in the Austrian
Netherlands.</p>

<p>In June, 1744, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment
embarked for Flanders, and joining the allied army at
the camp on the bank of the Scheldt, took part in
several operations. It penetrated the territory subject
to France to the vicinity of Lisle; and subsequently
returned to Flanders, where it passed the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>The French monarch assembled a numerous army
in the spring of 1745, and commenced operations by
besieging the strong fortress of Tournay; and the Duke
of Cumberland, having arrived in Flanders, assembled
the allied army with the view of raising the siege.
The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were called from their quarters
in April, to take part in this service; and when the
allied army approached, the French took up a position
at the village of <em>Fontenoy</em>.</p>

<p><span class="transnote">(Uniform of Private Soldiers in 1742)</span></p>
<p class="rt fs60">(<em>To face page 24.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>At an early hour on the morning of the 11th of
May, the allied army advanced to engage the enemy,
and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment entered the plain
in front of the French batteries, to take part in the
action. Soon after nine o’clock, the British infantry
moved forward to attack the French position on the
right of the village of Fontenoy, and their gallant
bearing, in the face of a storm of grape and musketry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
excited admiration; by a resolute charge they broke
the French lines; but the Dutch failed in their attack,
and the British regiments were forced to retire. A
second attack was made, and the heroic valour of the
English infantry was conspicuous; their steady fire
destroyed entire ranks of their enemy, and the determined
charge with the bayonet proved irresistible; but
the Dutch again failed, and a retreat was ordered. The
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment evinced great gallantry on
this occasion, and it had the honor of performing a
conspicuous part in covering the retreat, and in bringing
up the rear of the right wing out of the plain, to
the village of Vezont. The determined bearing of the
regiment, with that of the Thirty-second Foot, and the
brigade of Life Guards under Major-General the Earl
of Crawford, intimidated the enemy, and the retreat
was effected, without serious loss, to the town of Aeth.</p>

<p>The regiment had one serjeant and seventeen rank
and file killed; Lieutenants Cramer, Forrest, Mure,
Courtenay, and Hargraves, Ensigns Donallen and
Stacey, two serjeants, and fifty-three rank and file
wounded; one serjeant and twenty-seven rank and file
missing.</p>

<p>The regiment was afterwards encamped on the
plains of Lessines; and was subsequently employed in
operations of a defensive character; but the enemy had
so great a superiority of numbers, that it was found
impossible to prevent the loss of several fortified
towns.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Charles Edward, eldest son of
the Pretender, had arrived in Scotland, and being
joined by the Highland clans, he resolved to make a
desperate effort to overthrow the existing government.
The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> regiment was ordered to return
to England on this occasion; it left the camp at Vilvorde
on the 13th of September, embarked at Williamstadt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
on the 19th, and arriving in the river Thames on
the 23rd, landed at Blackwall, from whence it was
ordered to proceed to Newcastle, where a body of
troops was assembling under Field-Marshal Wade.
Having joined this force, the regiment was formed in
brigade with the Buffs, the Thirteenth, and Forty-eighth
Regiments, and when the clans penetrated
England, it marched by Durham, Darlington, and
Richmond, in order to cover Yorkshire, and eventually
proceeded to Ferrybridge, where it arrived on the 8th
of December. When the Highlanders quitted Derby,
and made a precipitate retreat to Scotland, the regiment
was engaged in the attempt to intercept their
return; but the clans escaped with the loss of a few
men killed in a skirmish on Clifton moor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>Early in January, 1746, the regiment marched to
Edinburgh, from whence it advanced, with the troops
under Lieutenant-General Hawley, to <em>Falkirk</em>, for the
purpose of forcing the insurgents to raise the siege of
Stirling castle.</p>

<p>The clans quitted Stirling, and on the 17th of
January, they advanced to Falkirk moor; when the
King’s troops marched to attack the insurgents. As
the royal army diverged upon the moor, a storm was
seen approaching, and as the soldiers moved forward to
commence the battle, a violent hurricane, with a heavy
shower of rain, beat violently in their faces, and nearly
blinded them; at the same time, it beat on the backs
of the Highlanders and caused them little annoyance.
The engagement commenced under great disadvantages
to the King’s troops, who could not see to take aim;
more than half the muskets would not give fire, and the
powder became wet and useless while the men were in
the act of loading.</p>

<p>Being thus blinded and confounded by the storm,
several regiments faced about and retreated. Others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
stood firm and repulsed the clans; but during the
night the whole retired. The regiment lost its commanding
officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Powell, who was
mortally wounded on this occasion. Its colonel, Brigadier-General
the Honorable James Cholmondeley,
highly distinguished himself.</p>

<p>The troops in Scotland were reinforced: his Royal
Highness the Duke of Cumberland assumed the command,
and on the 31st of January they again advanced;
when the Pretender raised the siege of Stirling castle,
and made a precipitate retreat. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
were engaged in the pursuit of the clans to Perth,
where the army halted in consequence of the severe
weather, until the 20th of February, when the march
was resumed, and in the beginning of the following
month the army arrived at Aberdeen, where its progress
was retarded by heavy rains and snow storms.
In the early part of April, the King’s troops were again
in motion towards Inverness, and on the 16th of that
month, they discovered the clans in order of battle on
<em>Culloden moor</em>, when they formed line opposite the
hostile ranks; the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, or Cholmondeley’s<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>,
five hundred men, being in the right wing of
the front line, and on the left of the second battalion
of the Royal regiment.</p>

<p>The action commenced between twelve and one
o’clock, and in less than one hour the rebel army was
overpowered and chased from the moor with great
slaughter. This victory was decisive, and it instantly
transformed the young Pretender from an imaginary
monarch to a humble fugitive; an interval of hardship
and suffering followed, and after wandering for some
time in disguise, among the isles and mountains, he
escaped to France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment at the
battle of Culloden<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was limited to three private
soldiers. After returning from the pursuit of the clans,
the regiment was encamped a short time near Inverness,
and it was subsequently employed in escorting
prisoners towards South Britain. The rebellion being
finally suppressed, the services of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
were no longer required in Scotland, and they were
stationed in England.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1748<br />1749</div>

<p>The war of the Austrian succession was terminated
in 1748, by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and in 1749
the regiment was placed on a peace establishment.</p>

<p>Major-General the Honorable James Cholmondeley
was removed to the Twelfth Dragoons, in July, 1749;
and was succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Foot by Colonel the Honorable Henry Seymour
Conway, from the Forty-eighth Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1751, regulations were issued,
under the sign manual, for establishing uniformity in
the clothing, standards, and colours of the several
regiments; in which the facings of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
were directed to be of <em>bright yellow</em>. The
first, or the King’s colour, was to be the Great Union;
the second, or regimental colour, to be of bright yellow
silk, with the Union in the upper canton; in the centre
of the colour, the rank of the regiment in gold Roman
characters, within a wreath of roses and thistles on the
same stalk. The costume of the regiment at this period
was three-cornered cocked hats, bound with white lace,
and ornamented with a white loop and a black cockade;
scarlet coats faced and lined with bright yellow, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
ornamented with white lace; scarlet waistcoats and
breeches; and white gaiters.</p>

<p>In December of this year, Colonel the Honorable
Henry Seymour Conway was removed to the Thirteenth
Dragoons, and King George II. conferred the
colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Foot, on Colonel
the Honorable Charles Russell, from major in the
Second Foot Guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1752<br />1753</div>

<p>Early in the year 1752, the regiment embarked for
Minorca, the second of the Balearic islands, situated in
the Mediterranean, near the coast of Spain: this island
had fallen successively under the dominion of the
Carthaginians, the Romans, the Vandals, the Moors,
the Arragonese, and the Castilians; in 1708 it was
captured by the British, and it was ceded to Queen
Anne at the peace of Utrecht in 1713. In this small
island, which is diversified with hills and valleys, and
in some parts rich in vegetation, and abounding with
the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life, the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were stationed several years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1754</div>

<p>Colonel the Honorable Charles Russell died on the
20th of November, 1754, and was succeeded in the
command of the regiment by Lieutenant-Colonel
Thomas Earl of Effingham, from the second troop,
now second regiment, of Life Guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755<br />1756</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed at Minorca, the
undetermined limits of the British and French territory
in North America, occasioned a war between the two
kingdoms; and early in 1756, the French monarch
prepared a powerful armament for the capture of the
island of <em>Minorca</em>.</p>

<p>The French expedition, commanded by Marshal
Duke of Richelieu, arrived at Minorca in April, and
effected a landing at Ciudadella; and no part of the
island being fortified to resist so powerful a force,
excepting <em>Fort St. Philip</em>, situate on a rocky promontory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
at the entrance of the harbour of Port Mahon, the
several detachments were withdrawn from the interior,
and assembled in the fort, where they resolved on
making a desperate defence, in the hope of being reinforced.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> mustered twenty-six officers,
twenty-nine serjeants, nineteen drummers, and six
hundred and sixty-five rank and file fit for duty, exclusive
of thirteen sick, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
John Reed, for the defence of Fort St.
Philip, and the officers and soldiers evinced an extent
of personal bravery and resolution, which reflected
honor on their country. The garrison was commanded
by Lieutenant-General Blakeney.</p>

<p>The siege of the fort was commenced by the
enemy, and the determined resistance encountered by
the French commander occasioned him to send for
additional forces. The conduct of the garrison became
a subject of admiration, and the bravery and vigilance
of the officers inspired the soldiers with increased
confidence.</p>

<p>The British fleet was discovered on the 19th of
May, and the soldiers, having become exhausted by
hard duty, were stimulated to perseverance by the
prospect of being speedily relieved; but were disappointed:
Admiral Byng skirmished with the French
squadron, and afterwards retired, for which conduct he
was subsequently brought to trial, and shot. Lieutenant-General
Thomas Fowke, then commanding at
Gibraltar, was also brought to trial, for not sending a
reinforcement to Minorca, and sentenced to be suspended
for one year; the king confirmed the sentence,
and directed Lieutenant-General Fowke to be dismissed
the service.</p>

<p>Although thus abandoned to their fate, the four
regiments in garrison at Fort St. Philip, (viz., the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Fourth, Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth, and <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>)
defended their post with great gallantry;
incessant duty and watching so exhausted the soldiers,
that they frequently were overpowered by sleep under
a heavy cannonade, yet they persevered with admirable
resolution. During the night of the 27th of June, a
general assault was made by the enemy at several
points, when the garrison met the assailants with great
courage, and repulsed them several times with much
slaughter,&mdash;many of the sick and wounded coming out
of the hospital to take part in the defence. The
enemy’s superior numbers enabled him to renew the
attack, and after much severe fighting he gained possession
of three of the outworks. On the following day,
conditions of capitulation were tendered and accepted;
when the French marshal caused it to be inserted in
the articles,&mdash;“The noble and vigorous defence which
the English have made, having deserved all the marks
of esteem and veneration which every military man
ought to show to such actions, and Marshal Richelieu
being desirous also to show to General Blakeney the
regard due to the defence he has made, grants to the
garrison all the honors of war they can enjoy under
the circumstances of going out for an embarkation;
to wit,&mdash;firelocks on their shoulders, drums beating,
colours flying, twenty cartridges each man, and also
lighted match. He consents, also, that General
Blakeney and his garrison carry away all the effects
that belong to them.”</p>

<p>On this subject, Beatson observes in his <cite>Naval and
Military Memoirs</cite>,&mdash;“Thus did four regiments, and one
company of artillery, maintain the fort against such
numbers of the enemy, by sea and land, for such a
length of time, as can, perhaps, scarcely be paralleled
in history. The terms on which the fort was at last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
surrendered by a handful of men, so distressed, so
shattered, and so neglected, remains a lasting monument
to their honor.”</p>

<p>The regiment had Captain Hobby, Lieutenant
Armstrong, and twelve rank and file killed during the
siege; also Captain Sir Hugh Williams, Bart., and
seventy-seven non-commissioned officers and soldiers
wounded; seven men died of their wounds, and two of
diseases produced by excessive exertion: at the general
assault the regiment only lost four men.</p>

<p>Immediately after the surrender of Fort St. Philip,
the regiment embarked for Gibraltar, and after a short
stay at that fortress, proceeded to England, where its
arrival was hailed with acclamations by the inhabitants
of the towns through which it passed, who were proud
of the honor acquired by the regiments which defended
the principal fortress of Minorca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757</div>

<p>Soon after its arrival in England the regiment was
augmented to <em>two battalions</em>, and in the summer of
1757, both battalions were encamped on Barham
downs, under the Duke of Marlborough: the second
battalion afterwards served on board the fleet as
marines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>In June, 1758, the second battalion was constituted
the <em>Seventy-third Regiment</em>, under the command of
Colonel Browne. This regiment was disbanded at the
peace in 1763.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment proceeded to the
Isle of Wight, where it was formed in brigade with the
Twenty-fourth and Seventy-second Regiments, under
the orders of Major-General Granville Elliott, and
sailed with the armament, under the Duke of Marlborough,
for the purpose of reducing the maritime
power of France, and making a diversion in favour of
the allied army in Germany. A landing was effected
on the coast of Brittany on the 5th of June, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
French infantry and cavalry assembled to oppose the
debarkation were quickly dispersed. On the 7th of
June the army advanced in two columns towards <em>St.
Maloes</em>, and encamping about a mile from the town,
sent a strong detachment to the harbour, to set fire to
the shipping, magazines, and maritime stores, when a
grand and dreadful scene of conflagration illuminated
the coast, and was seen for many miles. Having
destroyed a valuable fleet, and extensive magazines of
maritime stores, the troops re-embarked, and preparations
were afterwards made for a descent at Granville,
on the coast of Normandy, and afterwards at Cherbourg;
but the weather being severe, the fleet returned to
England.</p>

<p>This success was followed by the preparation of
another expedition of a similar character, in which the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment was also employed; and on
the 6th of August a landing was effected in the Bay des
Marées, in the face of a body of French troops. On the
following day <em>Cherbourg</em> was taken possession of, with
the harbour, forts, magazines, and about two hundred
pieces of ordnance; the iron guns were destroyed, and
twenty-two fine brass cannon and two brass mortars,
were sent to England as trophies. These guns were
seen by King George II., in Hyde Park, and afterwards
conducted by a cavalcade to the Tower.</p>

<p>After remaining in France ten days, the troops returned
on board the fleet, and a second descent was
made on the coast of Brittany on the 4th of September,
when the batteries in the Bay of St. Lunaire were
destroyed, and the troops afterwards penetrated the
country a considerable distance; but no advantage
resulted from this enterprise, and when the troops
re-embarked at <em>St. Cas</em>, the enemy attacked the rear
guard with superior numbers, and occasioned severe
loss. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Foot returned to England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
and landed at Portsmouth towards the end of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759<br />1760</div>

<p>In the summer of 1759, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were
encamped at Sandheath, with the Fifth, Eighth, and
Thirty-third Regiments, under the Earl of Ancram;
and in the summer of 1760, they pitched their tents at
Winchester, where five battalions of militia were encamped
with them, the whole under the colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>,&mdash;Thomas Earl of Effingham.</p>

<p>On the 30th of October, King George III. nominated
the Earl of Effingham to the command of the
first troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, (which was
incorporated in the First Regiment of Life Guards in
1788,) and his Majesty conferred the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> on Lord Frederick Cavendish, from
the Sixty-seventh Regiment<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>During the summer of 1761, the regiment was
encamped, with the Seventy-second Foot, at Sandheath,
under Lieutenant-General Cornwallis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>Meanwhile the conduct of the Spanish Government
had led to an interruption of the amicable relations
existing between the two countries, and in the early
part of 1762 an attack on the <em>Havannah</em>, in the island
of Cuba, which was looked upon as a key to the
Spanish settlements in the West Indies, was resolved
upon by the British Government; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment, mustering one thousand officers
and soldiers, under Lieutenant-Colonel John Reed,
embarked for this service; the expedition being under
General the Earl of Albemarle. On arriving at the
West Indies, the regiment was formed in brigade with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the Thirty-fifth, Forty-third, and Seventy-fifth Regiments,
under Brigadier-General Reed; and proceeding
with the armament through the Straits of Bahama,
arrived in the vicinity of the Havannah on the 6th of
June. On the following day a landing was effected,
and the siege of the <em>Moro Fort</em> was commenced by a
body of troops under Major-General the Honorable
William Keppel. In the attack of this fortress, the
troops evinced that courage and patient perseverance
under severe toil and privation, for which British
soldiers have been distinguished, and united with the
cordial co-operation of the royal navy, overcame all
difficulties. Batteries were erected, the sallies of the
Spaniards repulsed, and the Moro Fort captured by
storm on the 30th of July. This success facilitated the
attack on the Havannah, and a series of batteries
opened so well-directed a fire on the works of the town,
and on the shipping in the harbour, on the 11th of
August, that in a few hours the guns of the garrison
were silenced, and the Spaniards solicited terms of
capitulation, which were speedily agreed upon. The
wealthy city of the Havannah, with a valuable fleet of
Spanish men-of-war, and numerous stores, were thus
captured by British skill and valour, and prize money
to a large amount was afterwards distributed to the
army and navy. “This conquest was, without doubt,
in itself the most considerable, and in its consequences
the most decisive, of any we had made since the
beginning of the war; and in no operation were the
courage, steadiness, and perseverance of the British
troops, and the conduct of their leaders, more conspicuous.
It was a military achievement of the highest
class<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.”</p>

<p>The regiment was commanded, on this occasion, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Major Robert Farmar, (Lieutenant-Colonel Reed being
at the head of the brigade,) and after taking part in
this splendid conquest, it was stationed a short time at
the Havannah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>In the following year a treaty of peace was concluded,
and the Spaniards ceded to Great Britain the
country of Florida, in North America, on condition of
having the Havannah restored to them, which was
agreed to; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment was one
of the corps which proceeded to North America, to
take possession of the ceded territory.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1764<br />1768<br />1769</div>

<p>In the pleasant and fertile country of West Florida,
the regiment was stationed some time; in 1768 it was
relieved from duty in North America, and returned to
Europe, and in 1769 it was stationed in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1770<br />1774</div>

<p>The regiment was quartered in Ireland seven years;
and was equally conspicuous for good conduct on home
service, as it had been for gallantry when confronting
the enemies of its country abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>In 1775, the misunderstanding between Great Britain
and her North American provinces, on the subject
of taxation, attained a character which produced hostilities,
and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment was augmented
to the war establishment. The American
Congress sent a body of troops, under Colonel Montgomery,
to invade Canada, where Major-General
Carleton, afterwards Lord Dorchester, commanded, and
the English general, having very few troops to oppose
to the enemy, evacuated Montreal, and retired to
<em>Quebec</em>. The Americans detached a division of troops,
under Colonel Arnold, to surprise Quebec; but this
enterprise failed, through the activity and vigilance of
Major-General Carleton, who defended that fortress
against the united provincial forces, and repulsed an
assault made on the works, during a snow storm, in the
depth of winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment embarked from
Ireland early in the spring of 1776, for the relief of
Quebec; and on the arrival, in the river St. Lawrence,
of the expected succours from the United Kingdom, in
May, the Americans quitted the vicinity of that fortress,
and made a precipitate retreat. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment advanced up the country in pursuit
of the provincial troops, and took part in the movements
by which the Americans were driven out of
Canada. The regiment was stationed in Canada during
the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>In the spring of 1777, the flank companies of the
regiment were detached from Canada, with the army
under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, which was destined
to proceed, by Lakes Champlain and George, to
Hudson’s river, with the view of forcing its way to
Albany, and co-operating with the army at New York,
in the reduction of the revolted states. The troops
employed on this service embarked on board a flotilla,
and, after a pleasant voyage along Lake Champlain,
landed at Crown Point, from whence they advanced
towards Ticonderago, and forced the Americans to
abandon the fort. This conquest achieved, the troops
proceeded to Skenesborough, and drove the enemy
from a stockaded fort on the 6th of July, and pursued
them towards Castletown. On the 8th of July the
Americans were repulsed in an attack on the Ninth
Regiment, and driven from Fort Anne. After this
success, preparations were made for a forward movement;
but extraordinary difficulties had to be encountered;
felled trees had to be removed from the roads,&mdash;creeks
and marshes had to be passed,&mdash;forty new
bridges had to be constructed, and others to be repaired;
one made of log-work crossed a morass two
miles in extent. These difficulties were overcome by
the soldiers with cheerful alacrity, and on the 30th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
July the troops arrived on the banks of the Hudson’s
river, when they took post at Fort Edward, awaiting
the arrival of provisions. The river was crossed in
September, and a forward movement was made; but
the expedition proved of insufficient force for the enterprise,
and the means for supplying the troops inadequate.
Having penetrated into the heart of the revolted provinces,
Lieutenant-General Burgoyne found himself
encompassed by difficulties and dangers which he was
unable to overcome. After a series of hard toil, incessant
effort, and severe privation, the Indian warriors,
who formed part of the expedition, deserted, and many
of the Canadians followed their example; and after
several stubborn engagements, in which the British
regiments fought gallantly against an immense superiority
of numbers, and the flank companies of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Foot had repeated opportunities of
distinguishing themselves, Lieutenant-General Burgoyne
found himself on the banks of the Hudson’s
river, with an army diminished in numbers to three
thousand five hundred men,&mdash;reduced in physical power
by incessant toil and want of provisions,&mdash;invested by
an army of sixteen thousand Americans,&mdash;disappointed
of co-operation from other armies,&mdash;and without provision.
Under these dismal circumstances, a convention
was concluded with the American General Gates, at
Saratoga, in which it was agreed that the troops should
lay down their arms, on condition of being sent to
England, and of not serving in America during the
remainder of the war. These articles were violated by
the American government, and the brave soldiers who
had fought so gallantly, and who did not submit until
surrounded by five times their own numbers, were
detained prisoners in America.</p>

<p>The battalion companies of the regiment, which had
remained in Canada, were not involved in this occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>In the several actions between the Americans and
the troops under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, the
flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> had a number
of men killed and wounded; also Captains Harris and
Ross, and Lieutenant Richardson, wounded.</p>

<p>The battalion companies furnished a detachment of
one hundred men, for the expedition to the <em>Mohawk</em>,
under Brigadier-General Barry St. Leger. This detachment
was engaged in the unsuccessful siege of <em>Fort
Stanwix</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment formed part of the
force to which the protection of Canada was confided
during the remainder of the American war, which was
terminated in 1782, by a treaty of peace, in which the
independence of the United States was acknowledged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>A letter, dated the 31st of August, 1782, conveyed
to the regiment His Majesty’s pleasure that it should
assume the title of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth, or Cumberland
Regiment of Foot</span>, and that a connection and
mutual attachment between the corps and that county
should be cultivated, in order to promote the success of
the recruiting service.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1786<br />1787</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Canada until 1786, when
it was relieved, and returned to Europe. In 1787 it
was stationed in England.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1792<br />1793<br />1795</div>

<p>On the breaking out of the French revolutionary
war, the establishment of the regiment was augmented.
In 1793 a British army proceeded to Flanders; but the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> remained in Great Britain until the
middle of February, 1795, when they embarked for the
West Indies.</p>

<p>Previous to this date the revolutionary principles,
which had involved France in anarchy and crime, had
extended to the French West India islands; but the
planters of these colonies had been delivered from the
power of the republicans by a British armament, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
General Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey; the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Dickens, proceeded to St. Lucia, which island
had been captured from the French in April, 1794.</p>

<p>The National Convention which governed France,
although employed in extending revolutionary power in
Europe, paid so much attention to the colonial interests
of that nation, as to send an expedition to the West
Indies, for the recovery of the conquered islands; and
the doctrines of liberty and equality, which were disseminated
in the islands, occasioned multitudes of
mulattoes, blacks, and Charibbees to array themselves
under the standard of republicanism, which led to a
frightful catalogue of outrages and depredations. <em>St.
Lucia</em>, where the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were stationed, was
among the colonies attacked by the enemy, and the
regiment was engaged a short period in its defence, in
which it lost several men, and Captain Dodsworth was
taken prisoner, on the 18th of June. The British
troops not being sufficiently numerous for the defence
of the island, it was evacuated, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment proceeding to <em>St. Vincent</em>, where republican
emissaries from France had organised a rebellion, and
many whites, mulattoes, blacks, and native Charibbees,
were in arms against the British Government, which
occasioned the regiment much severe service<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>Early in 1796, additional forces arrived at the
West Indies, where Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph
Abercromby assumed the command of an armament to
complete the deliverance of the West India islands from
the power of the republicans, and to reduce to obedience
the insurgents of St. Vincent and Grenada.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June, a body of troops landed at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
<ins class="corr" id="tn-41" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'sland of St.'">
island of St.</ins> Vincent, and were joined by the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Dickens, who had the honour of taking a distinguished
part in the reduction of the colony, which was accomplished
in a few days. Part of the regiment evinced
signal gallantry at the assault and capture of the insurgent
camp, on, the 10th of June, when Sir Ralph
Abercromby stated in orders,&mdash;“Lieutenant-Colonel
Dickens, and the troops who served under him, are
entitled to a great share of praise.” The regiment
had two serjeants, one drummer, and six rank and file
killed; Volunteer Gordon died of his wounds; Lieutenants
O’Donoughue and Georges, nine serjeants,
three drummers, and sixteen rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The hostile spirit long shown by the Charibbees
towards the European inhabitants, occasioned the British
Government to determine to remove them from the
island; and the execution of the orders received for
this purpose was attended with much harassing duty
to the troops, in which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> took part,
and sustained some loss. The regiment afterwards
received the thanks of Major-General Hunter, and of
the principal inhabitants of the colony, for its conduct
in the brigand and Charibbee war.</p>

<p>On the 15th of July, the regiment embarked for
England, where it arrived on the 8th of October, and
was stationed at Poole, in Dorsetshire, from whence
recruiting parties were detached to various towns in
South Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>In the spring of 1797<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, the regiment proceeded to
York, where the non-commissioned officers and soldiers
evinced their loyalty and zeal for the preservation of
the constitution of their country, by a contribution in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
aid of the war, for which they received the thanks of
Lieutenant-General Scott, commanding the district.
In the autumn the regiment marched to Lincoln.</p>

<p>Field-Marshal Lord Frederick Cavendish was succeeded
in the colonelcy of the regiment in July by
George Frederick Lord Southampton, from captain and
lieutenant-colonel Second Foot Guards.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1798<br />1799</div>

<p>The regiment remained in England during the
years 1798 and 1799, and, having been brought into a
high state of discipline and efficiency, it was selected to
proceed on colonial service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>In January, 1800, the regiment marched from
Hilsea barracks, and embarking on board an Indiaman,
sailed to the Cape of Good Hope, where it landed on
the 21st of May, and occupied barracks at Cape Town
until September, when it pitched its tents at Wynberg,
where a numerous force was encamped under Major-General
Dundas.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1801<br />1802<br />1803</div>

<p>After remaining two years and a half at the Cape of
Good Hope, that colony was restored to the Dutch, at
the peace of Amiens, in 1802, and the regiment
embarked for the East Indies, where it arrived in
January, 1803, and landed at Madras on the 2nd of
February.</p>

<p>The regiment was stationed at Madras several
months, during which period the conduct of the officers
and soldiers on the occasion of an alarming fire, elicited
the following communication to Colonel Dickens, from
the merchants of that place:&mdash;“Impressed with a
grateful sense of the extraordinary exertions manifested
by the officers and men of His Majesty’s
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment, under your command,
on the occasion of the late calamitous fires, we feel it
incumbent upon us to offer you and them our public
acknowledgements for the service rendered to the
commercial interests in particular, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
time to request you will be assured of our sincere
respect for the public spirit which uniformly animates
the British military on every emergency.”</p>

<p>The peace of Europe was violated by the ambitious
projects of Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul of
France, and the war was resumed in 1803, in July of
which year two companies of the regiment embarked,
under Captain Everard, for the island of Ceylon, which
had been captured from the Dutch, and they were
followed by two additional companies, under Captain
Roberts, in October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>In 1804 the head-quarters were removed from
Madras to Wallajabad, where they arrived on the 21st
of August. In December a detachment returned to
Madras, where it embarked for Vizagapatam, to protect
the shipping.</p>

<p>In the mean time the menace of invading England,
made by Napoleon Bonaparte, had been followed by a
simultaneous appeal to arms throughout the United
Kingdom, and an array of military power was manifested
which proved the attachment of the British
people to their sovereign and constitution. On this
memorable occasion a <em>second battalion</em> was added to the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment, and was embodied at
Ashford, in Kent. It was formed of volunteers from
the First East York, Third West York, First Lancashire,
South Lincoln, and East Essex Regiments of
Militia, and was placed on the establishment of the
army on the 25th of April, 1805.</p>

<p>Soon after its formation, the second battalion
marched to Colchester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span> obtained the dignity of <span class="smcap">Emperor</span>
from the French nation, was crowned King of Italy,
and added Genoa to his dominions; he afterwards
marched his army from Boulogne to crush the coalition
forming against his interests in Germany; at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
same time the French troops were withdrawn from
Hanover, which country they had seized soon after
the resuming of hostilities in 1803. A body of troops
was sent to Hanover under Lieutenant-General Lord
Cathcart, to co-operate with the continental powers;
and on the 28th of November the second battalion of
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment marched to Ramsgate
for embarkation for Germany, under the orders of
Major Broomhead. The battle of Austerlitz established
the preponderance of French power; in a
subsequent treaty it was stipulated that Hanover
should be occupied by the Prussians, and the British
troops, under Lord Cathcart, withdrew to the coast
and embarked for England. On its return from this
expedition, the battalion was quartered on the coast of
Sussex.</p>

<p>In March of this year, the detachment of the first
battalion was withdrawn from Ceylon, and joined the
head-quarters at Wallajabad; and in April four companies
proceeded to the fortress of Vellore, which had
been chosen for the residence of the captive princes of
the race of Hyder and Tippoo, with the two hostages
given up to Lord Cornwallis. In October, the battalion
was united at Bellary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>During the year 1806, the first battalion was in
garrison at the fortresses of Gooty and Bellary. Lieutenant-Colonel
Fancourt of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment
was commandant of Vellore, and was killed in the
mutiny which took place among the Sepoys and Moormen,
on the morning of the 10th July, 1806.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>In April, the second battalion embarked for the
island of Jersey, where it remained until May, 1807,
when it was removed to the Isle of Wight, in order to
its embarkation for the island of Ceylon; but while
waiting for shipping, its destination was changed, and
it proceeded to Cork, to join a secret expedition
ordered to rendezvous at that place, under Brigadier-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Beresford. The expedition sailed to Madeira,
and took possession of that island; but the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
landed in Ireland, were stationed at Bandon
barracks, and placed under orders to proceed to India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>In December they embarked from Cork, and
sailed to Spithead, where they arrived on the 18th of
January, 1808; but circumstances had occurred which
occasioned their embarkation for India to be countermanded;
they landed and marched to Steyning barracks,
where they remained until May, when they
returned to the island of Jersey.</p>

<p>During this period, the first battalion had remained
at Gooty and Bellary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The second battalion was stationed at Jersey until
the summer of 1809, when it was completed to a
thousand rank and file by volunteers from the militia,
and embarked for the Peninsula, to join the British
army, under Sir Arthur Wellesley, and take part in the
deliverance of Portugal and Spain from the tyrannical
domination of the Emperor Napoleon, who was
attempting to bring those kingdoms under his despotic
sway. After landing at Lisbon, on the 4th of July,
the battalion was encamped near that place, with the
brigade under Brigadier-General James Catlin Craufurd,
for three weeks, and afterwards proceeded in
boats up the river Tagus, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Maister, to Santarem, from whence it marched into
Spain, to co-operate with the troops under Lieutenant-General
Lord Wellington, who had driven the French
from Portugal, and repulsed the army under Joseph
Bonaparte (titular King of Spain) at Talavera, a short
time before. After several movements, the brigade
joined the army under Lord Wellington in Spanish
Estremadura; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were placed
in village cantonments on the right bank of the Guadiana,
near Badajoz, where the battalion suffered from
the epidemic fever which thinned the British ranks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>When Lord Wellington marched northward, the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were left in Portuguese Estremadura,
under Lieutenant-General Sir Rowland Hill.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the disaffection to the civil
authorities of Madras, which occurred in the native
army in India, particularly among the European officers,
had occasioned the first battalion to be withdrawn
from garrison, and to be employed in services necessary
to bring the disaffected to submission; at the same
time four captains and eight lieutenants were attached
to the Company’s artillery, and to the Seventh, Ninth,
Twenty-second, and Twenty-fifth Regiments of native
infantry, in the place of the suspended officers: officers
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were also appointed to perform
the duties of assistant adjutant-general, fort-adjutant,
and deputy judge advocate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment performed many
long marches with the field force, under Colonel
Conran, of the First, or the Royal Regiment of Foot,
in October, November, and December, 1809, and it
was also frequently in motion during the first four
months of 1810. On the 8th of May it encamped at
Jaulnah, and was in tents during the periodical heavy
rains: in October it moved into temporary barracks.
Previous to this period, the arrival of Lord Minto,
Governor-General of India, had been followed by
happy results, and the authority of the civil government
of Madras had been restored.</p>

<p>In the Peninsula, the immense preparations of the
French for the campaign of 1810, induced Lord
Wellington to limit his operations to the defence of
Portugal; and the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
was employed, with the division under Lieutenant-General
Sir Rowland Hill, on the Alemtejo
frontier, in opposition to the French under General
Reynier. Portugal being invaded by a powerful
French army, under Marshal Massena, Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Esling, the British forces withdrew before the superior
numbers of the enemy. The movements of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were the same as those of the second
division of the army, and after passing the Mondego
river, early on the morning of the 26th of September,
they took post on the right of the position on the
rocks of <em>Busaco</em>, where an array of British power was
prepared to resist the torrent of invasion. The Prince
of Esling assailed this position on the 27th of September,
when the furious attacks of the veteran legions
of Napoleon were repulsed by British valour. After
astonishing efforts, the French fell back; and they
subsequently turned the left of the position by a flank
movement; when the British commander withdrew to
the lines of <em>Torres Vedras</em>, where a series of works,
along a range of lofty mountains, opposed a formidable
barrier to the progress of the enemy. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
had their post in the lines, and were stationed
at Calendrix, and afterwards at Bucellas.</p>

<p>The French commander viewed the stupendous
works of Torres Vedras with surprise, and being unable
to accomplish his menace of driving the English into
the sea, and planting the eagles of France on the
towers of Lisbon, he withdrew to Santarem in the
middle of November. On the retrograde movement of
the enemy taking place, the division of which the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> formed part, was ordered to cross the
Tagus, and move upon Abrantes, to succour that place,
or head the march of the enemy. The battalion
passed the river on rafts; but when the enemy was
found in position at Santarem, Sir Rowland Hill’s
division was ordered to halt at Chamusca.</p>

<p>The battalion passed the winter in village cantonments
on the left bank of the Tagus, and the country
being low and marshy, the health of the soldiers suffered
from agues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>On the decease of Lord Southampton, in the
summer of this year, the colonelcy of the regiment
was conferred on Lieutenant-General Sir Eyre Coote,
from the Sixty-second Foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>The first battalion suffered from the effects of the
climate at Jaulnah, in the East Indies, and was removed
in May, 1811, to Secunderabad; when it left
one hundred and thirty men in hospital.</p>

<p>To the second battalion was appointed the duty of
watching the movements of the enemy, to prevent the
passage of the Tagus by the French. On one occasion
an island in the river was taken possession of by a
detachment of the enemy; but the light companies of
the brigade, of which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> formed
part, dislodged the French, and the island was occupied
by a company of the regiment, until the 5th of March,
when the Prince of Esling quitted his position and
retreated.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> pursued the retreating enemy
towards the confines of Portugal, witnessing scenes of
slaughter, devastation, and confusion, produced by the
French army, beyond description; the battalion was
afterwards detached, with other forces, under Field-Marshal
Sir William Carr Beresford, to the relief of
<em>Campo Mayor</em>, which fortress was besieged by a detachment
from the French army, commanded by Marshal
Soult. This place surrendered before the troops
marching to its relief arrived, and as the British
approached, the French, having dismantled the works,
were marching out of the town, when some fighting
occurred, in which the Thirteenth Light Dragoons
evinced great gallantry.</p>

<p>The fortress of Olivenza was afterwards captured;
and the siege of <em>Badajoz</em> was commenced, in which the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were employed and sustained some
loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>While the siege of Badajoz was in progress,
Marshal Soult assembled a numerous force, and advanced
to the relief of that fortress, when Marshal
Beresford moved forward to meet him, and took up a
position at <em>Albuhera</em>, where he was joined by a Spanish
division under General Blake. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel William Fenwick,
were in position, and were formed in brigade with the
first battalion of the Twenty-eighth and the second
battalion of the Thirty-ninth Regiments, under Lieutenant-Colonel
the Honorable Alexander Abercromby.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th of May, the enemy
made a slight attack on the village of Albuhera, and on
the bridge, to draw attention to that point; and soon
afterwards powerful columns of infantry, supported by
a numerous force of cavalry and artillery, assailed the
heights on the right, from which the Spaniards were
forced to retire. Lieutenant-Colonel Colborne’s brigade
of the second division, under Lieutenant-General
Stewart, rushed up the heights with great gallantry;
but was nearly annihilated by a charge of the enemy’s
Polish lancers and hussars on its rear. Major-General
Hoghton reached the heights with the third brigade,
under a heavy cannonade, and was soon engaged in a
furious contest in which many officers and soldiers fell,
and Major-General Hoghton was shot in the act of
cheering his men: the battle raged with dreadful fury,
and this brigade was nearly destroyed.</p>

<p>At a critical moment the Fusiliers mounted the
hill on the right of the remnant of the third brigade,
at the same time the Twenty-eighth, <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>,
and Thirty-ninth passed on its left; and this gallant
line arrested the progress of the French columns, which
were pressing forward in anticipation of victory. The
heads of the enemy’s masses were broken by the steady
fire of the British soldiers, who closed on their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
numerous adversaries, and sternly contended for victory.
The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were severely engaged;
many officers and soldiers fell, and Ensign Sarsfield,
bearing the regimental colour, was shot; the colour
was seized by another officer, and the battalion pressed
forward upon its opponents, who, by a determined and
continued attack, were driven from the heights, and
the British soldiers stood victorious on the contested
hill.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult, finding that his French soldiers
could not force the position, withdrew beyond the
river, and the battle was thus won by the divisions of
the allied army, under Marshal Sir William Carr
Beresford, who stated in his public despatch,&mdash;“It is
impossible to enumerate every instance of discipline
and valour shown on this severely contested day;
but never troops more valiantly or more gloriously
maintained the honor of their respective countries.”</p>

<p>Captain George Gibbons, Lieutenant Thomas
Castle, and Ensign Sarsfield, with three serjeants, and
twenty-seven rank and file of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
were killed; and Captains G. J. Widdrington and John
Wyatt, Lieutenants John Hay, and &mdash;&mdash; Walsh, with
six serjeants, and eighty-five rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The word “<span class="smcap">Albuhera</span>,” displayed by royal
authority, on the colours of the regiment, commemorates
the distinguished gallantry of the second battalion
on this occasion; and a medal was conferred on
its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel William
Fenwick.</p>

<p>After the victory at Albuhera, the siege of <em>Badajoz</em>
was resumed; but the advance of two powerful French
armies, under Marshal Massena and Marshal Soult,
occasioned the British commander to raise the siege
and take post behind the Caya, where the superior
numbers of the enemy did not venture to attack him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
and in a short time the French retired. Lord Wellington
marched the main body of the army to the
province of Beira, leaving ten thousand infantry, with
a proportion of cavalry and artillery, in the Alemtejo,
under Sir Rowland Hill; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
formed a part of this force.</p>

<p>General Girard’s division of the Fifth French
corps having taken post at Caceres, Sir Rowland Hill
advanced, on the 22nd of October, to drive the enemy
from thence, and on the approach of the British troops,
the French retired, halting at <em>Arroyo de Molinos</em>, a
village situate in a plain at the foot of a ridge of rocks
rising in the form of a crescent. An opportunity
presenting itself to effect the surprise of this corps,
the British performed a forced march in cold, wet,
stormy weather, and arrived at the vicinity of the
village at daybreak on the morning of the 28th of
October, their approach being concealed by a thick mist
with heavy rain. The French infantry were assembling
outside the village to commence their march,
the baggage was being loaded, and General Girard was
waiting at his quarters for his horse, when suddenly
the Seventy-first and Ninety-second British Regiments
charged into the village, capturing much baggage and
many prisoners; at the same time the Twenty-eighth
and <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> made a detour, supported by the
Thirty-ninth, to cut off the enemy’s retreat. The
French formed two squares, and commenced retreating;
the British pressed resolutely upon their opponents;
the Thirteenth Light Dragoons captured the
French artillery, the Ninth Light Dragoons and
Second Hussars King’s German Legion overpowered
the enemy’s cavalry, and the Twenty-eighth and
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Foot cut off the retreat of the French
infantry by the main road. Thus beset on every
side, the French soldiers dispersed, and rushed with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
great speed up the steep mountain by an unfrequented
path; when the Twenty-eighth and <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
British Foot passed a ploughed field at a running pace,
and ascended the difficult precipice in pursuit, chasing
the enemy among the rugged heights, and capturing
many prisoners; a battalion of the <em>French Thirty-fourth
Regiment</em> being made prisoners on this occasion
by the second battalion of the British <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. The French General Brun, and Colonel
the Prince d’Aremberg, were among the prisoners.</p>

<p>Sir Rowland Hill, speaking of the troops employed
in this service, stated in his despatch,&mdash;“No praise of
mine can do full justice to their admirable conduct;
the patience and goodwill shown by all ranks during
forced marches, in the worst of weather; their strict
attention to the orders they received; the precision
with which they moved to the attack; and their obedience
to command during the action; in short, the
manner every one has performed his duty from the
commencement of the operation, merits my warmest
thanks.” The conduct of Lieutenant-Colonel Fenwick,
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, was particularly commanded.</p>

<p>After this exploit the troops returned to the Alemtejo.</p>

<p>Towards the end of December the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
again advanced into Spain, and were employed in operations
to surprise a body of French troops at Merida,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
under General Dombrouski. On arriving at <em>La Nava</em>,
the British cavalry found three hundred French infantry
and a party of hussars in the town, and this
body of troops, effecting its retreat to Merida with little
loss, informed General Dombrouski of the approach of
the British troops, and he retreated during the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>In January, 1812, the siege of <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em> was
undertaken, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> and other corps,
under Sir Rowland Hill, made a movement to co-operate
in covering the troops employed in this enterprise,
which ended in the capture of the besieged fortress by
storm on the 19th of January.</p>

<p>When the siege of <em>Badajoz</em> was undertaken, the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> formed part of the covering army,
and were stationed some time at Merida. The two
divisions of the covering army, under Sir Rowland Hill
and Sir Thomas Graham, afterwards advanced upon
Almendralejos and Llerena, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> moving
towards the former town. Marshal Soult collected
a numerous force and advanced to relieve <em>Badajoz</em>; but
learning that on the 6th of April that fortress was captured
by storm, he retraced his steps.</p>

<p>After the capture of Badajoz, Lord Wellington
proceeded towards the northern frontiers of Portugal,
leaving the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> in Estremadura, under Sir
Rowland Hill; and in May the battalion was employed
in an enterprise for the destruction of the enemy’s communication
across the Tagus at <em>Almaraz</em>. After a
march made with great secrecy, amidst various divisions
of the enemy, the troops approached the bridge,
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> being with the left column, which
was prepared with ladders to capture the fort of Mirabete
by escalade; but the difficulties of the march had
retarded the progress of the troops, and as the attack
could not be made before daylight, they remained concealed
in the mountains until the evening of the 18th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of May, when they moved forward. At daybreak, on
the following morning, the left column, of which the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> formed part, commenced a slight
attack on the castle of Mirabete, at the same time
another column captured the forts, which covered the
bridge, by storm.</p>

<p>Speaking of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, and other corps
which operated on the Mirabete, Sir Rowland Hill
stated in his despatch, “I regret much that the peculiar
situation of Mirabete should have prevented my
allowing the gallant corps to follow up an operation
which they had commenced with much spirit, and
were anxious to complete.”</p>

<p>The bridge having been destroyed, and the communication
between the several divisions of the French
army rendered more difficult, the British troops retired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>After the victory gained by the army under Lord
Wellington at Salamanca, the troops under Sir Rowland
Hill penetrated the Spanish provinces, and eventually
advanced upon Madrid: they afterwards occupied
a line from Toledo to Aranjuez. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
took part in these movements; and when the concentration
of the enemy’s forces rendered a retrograde
movement necessary, the battalion suffered, in common
with the other corps, the fatigues and privations consequent
upon this retreat;&mdash;the soldiers were not able
to procure any other food besides acorns, chesnuts, and
berries from the hedges, for nineteen days together;
and the inclemency of the weather augmented the sufferings
endured on this occasion. The retreat was
continued to the frontiers of Portugal, where the army
went into winter quarters.</p>

<p>During this year the first battalion was stationed at
Secunderabad, in the East Indies.</p>

<p>After passing several months in quarters in Estremadura,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
advanced, in May, 1813, with the troops under Sir
Rowland Hill, upon Salamanca, thus taking part in
the comprehensive movements by which the enemy’s
position on the Douro was turned, and the French
divisions forced to retreat. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> followed
the enemy in his retrograde movements, advancing
upon Valladolid, and afterwards upon Burgos, and
on the 12th of June the battalion took part in forcing
a strong body of French troops from <em>Hormaza</em>; which
was followed by the destruction of Burgos Castle, and
the retreat of the enemy behind the Ebro river. The
battalion took part in the movement through the wild
and beautiful regions towards the source of the Ebro,
and after traversing rocks, and mountains, and narrow
defiles, it crossed the Ebro; when the enemy again fell
back, and Joseph Bonaparte concentrated his force in
the valley of <em>Vittoria</em>, to arrest the progress of the
British arms.</p>

<p>After taking part in these brilliant operations, the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> had the honor to contribute to the
complete overthrow of the French army on the 21st of
June. On this occasion the battalion formed part of
the column under Lieutenant-General Sir Rowland
Hill, which advanced at day-break, and seizing the
bridge of Puebla, crossed the Zadora river; the Spaniards
under General Morillo attacking the heights of
La Puebla, and the British advancing along the Vittoria
road. The French commander sent a strong body
of troops to regain the heights, and two British battalions
were detached to aid the Spaniards. Before
the fighting at this point had ceased, Sir Rowland
Hill’s column issued fiercely from the defiles of Puebla,
and captured the village of Sabijana de Alava. The
heights at this point, some thickly wooded ground, and
the village, became the theatre of a severe contest, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Fenwick, were warmly engaged. The troops advanced
under a heavy cannonade; but undismayed by the
determined countenance of the foe, and regardless of a
shower of bullets, the British infantry rushed forward,
dislodged the enemy, and drove him back on his
reserve. In vain the French endeavoured to recover
the lost ground; columns of attack were formed, and
repeated efforts made; but all without success. The
other columns of the allied army were also victorious
at their several points of attack, and the legions of
Napoleon sustained a decisive overthrow; they were
driven from the field with the loss of their artillery,
baggage, and military chest, and were pursued until
dark.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> had ten rank and file killed;
Lieutenants T. G. Ball, Edward Mogridge, and Alan
B. Cairnes, four serjeants, and fifty-nine rank and file
wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Fenwick received a clasp, in
addition to his medal for the battle of Albuhera; and
the royal authority was afterwards given for the word
“<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>” to be inscribed on the regimental colours,
to commemorate the gallantry of the second battalion
on this occasion.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> followed the retreating
enemy to the foot of the Pyrenean mountains, and
were some time employed in the blockade of <em>Pampeluna</em>.
While on the march for this place, the battalion
was exposed, on the 24th of June, to a violent thunder-storm,
when Lieutenant Masterman, an officer of
approved gallantry and of great promise, was killed by
lightning: his horse was also killed under him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the enemy had withdrawn his
right and left into France, he maintained his centre in
force in the rich valley of <em>Bastan</em>, which afforded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
numerous strong positions; and the troops, under Sir
Rowland Hill, having been relieved from the blockade
of Pampeluna, advanced to dislodge the enemy. On
penetrating the mountains, in the early part of July,
the left wing of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> was engaged in
dislodging the enemy from one of the villages in the
pass. The battalion also took part in forcing the
French from the valley of Bastan, and being in advance,
on the 7th of July, it drove the enemy’s piquets from
the heights of Maya: it was afterwards attacked by a
strong line of French troops; but the Thirty-ninth
coming up, the two battalions repulsed the enemy by a
few well-directed volleys.</p>

<p>One private soldier of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> was
killed, and ten rank and file were wounded; Lieutenant
Ball, who had recovered of the wounds received at Vittoria,
was again severely wounded.</p>

<p>After taking part in forcing the enemy from the
valley of Bastan, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were employed
in guarding the <em>Col-de-Maya</em>, one of the entrances to
the valley; they were encamped in the Arestesque Pass,
about two miles from the summit of the mountain, and
furnished a piquet on the lofty rock of Arestesque.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult, having been appointed to the command
of the troops on the Pyrenees frontier of France,
assembled a numerous force to break through the
mountains, and relieve Pampeluna and St. Sebastian.
Captain Moyle Sherer, of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Foot,
commanded the piquet on the Arestesque rock, on the
morning of the 25th of July, and a glimpse of cavalry
and infantry advancing having been obtained at dawn,
the light companies were ordered to support the piquet.
These companies had just formed, with their left at the
rock, when three French divisions ascended the rock
and attacked the piquet, which defended its ground
with great gallantry, against overwhelming numbers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
until Captain Sherer was taken prisoner, and many men
had fallen, when the survivors fell back on the light
companies; and these troops sustained the assault of the
enemy with difficulty. The din of war echoed through
the valley, and the brigade, consisting of the Twenty-eighth,
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, and Thirty-ninth, hurried to
the scene of conflict. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> ascended
the rock first, by companies, at a running pace, and
arrived breathless from the length and ruggedness of
the ascent. The grenadier company was in front,
under Captain John Wyatt, who urged his men to
make a desperate effort, and fell pierced with many
bullets the instant he gained the summit; nearly every
man of the leading section experienced the same fate.
The other companies of the battalion rushed forward in
the face of a storm of musketry, and a determined,
but unavailing, effort was made. The commanding
officer, the adjutant, and many other brave officers
and soldiers, were struck by the tempest of balls.
After fighting with great desperation some time, the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, the light companies, and the piquet
were forced back by superior numbers, and the enemy
established his columns on the ridge of the position.
The British, however, retained possession of a rock,
which was the key of the pass, and the progress of the
enemy was arrested.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> had five hundred and thirty
officers and soldiers engaged on this occasion, and their
loss was Captain John Wyatt, Ensign T. W. Phillips,
one serjeant, and thirty-six rank and file killed; Adjutant
John Day mortally wounded and prisoner; Lieutenant-Colonel
Fenwick, Lieutenants P. S. Barron and
M. Simmons, Ensign S. Pickett, four serjeants, and
fifty-one rank and file wounded; Captain Moyle Sherer,
Lieutenant F. Hovenden, Ensigns F. Russell and
John Norman, one serjeant, one drummer, and seventy-seven
rank and file prisoners: many of the prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
were wounded. Total loss, one hundred and eighty-two.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Fenwick had his right leg
amputated above the knee; and the command of the
battalion devolved on Major Henry Worsley.</p>

<p>The enemy’s attacks being developed, and other
points of the position in the mountains forced, Sir
Rowland Hill retired during the night fifteen miles, to
a post in the rear of Irueta. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
halted on the heights of Irueta until the evening of the
27th, and marched during the night through the pass
of Villate, upon the town of Lanz, and afterwards upon
Lizasso: the British army went into position to cover
the blockade of Pampeluna, and the troops under Sir
Rowland Hill formed on the left of the line. Some
severe fighting occurred on the 28th of July, and the
resolute attacks of the enemy were repulsed with great
gallantry.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were not engaged on this
occasion. On the 30th of July Marshal Soult moved
a strong force against the troops under Sir Rowland
Hill, and a sharp combat took place, in which the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were engaged. During this contest
Lord Wellington directed an attack to be made at
another part of the enemy’s line, which proved decisive,
and the French were forced to make a precipitate
retreat through the mountains. Five rank and file of
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were killed on this occasion;
Lieutenant A. Orrell, one serjeant, and fifteen rank
and file wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Sir Rowland Hill was directed
to pursue the retreating enemy, on the road to Donna
Maria, and about ten o’clock on the morning of the
31st of July, the French rear-guard was overtaken
beyond Lizasso. The enemy gained a wood on the
summit of the pass, and there facing about, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
throwing out a number of skirmishers, offered formidable
resistance; the first brigade of the British second
division was repulsed, and Lieutenant-General the
Honorable William Stewart wounded; when the second
brigade, commanded by Colonel the Honorable R. W.
O’Callaghan, was ordered forward, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
took the lead on this occasion. Passing the
retreating troops, and advancing steadily up the hill,
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> soon gained the edge of the
wood, when the soldiers raised a loud and confident
shout, and rushed among the trees to decide the
contest with cold steel; but when the French saw a
line of British bayonets come sparkling through the
foliage, they fled in confusion along a defile, followed
by the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, who killed and wounded
many of the fugitives, and took some prisoners. The
pursuit was not continued above half a mile, in consequence
of a thick fog rendering any further advance
dangerous. The loss of the battalion was limited to
two men killed, thirteen wounded, and two made
prisoners.</p>

<p>Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Worsley received
a honorary distinction for commanding the
battalion in the several actions in the mountains, and
the word “<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>” on the regimental colours,
commemorates the distinguished conduct of the officers
and soldiers on this occasion.</p>

<p>The British troops resumed their positions in the
Pyrenees, awaiting the capture of St. Sebastian, and
Pampeluna, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were encamped
in Roncesvalles, &amp;c., until the end of October, when
a heavy snow storm obliged the battalion to leave the
mountains.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November, the troops descended
from the Pyrenees by moon-light, to transfer to France
the calamities of war, and the allied army drove the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
forces of Napoleon from a fortified position on the river
<em>Nivelle</em>, capturing many guns and prisoners. The
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> did not sustain any loss on this
occasion: they passed the night in the huts left by the
enemy, and afterwards advanced towards the Nive; but
operations were retarded by heavy rains, and the
battalion went into cantonments.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were afterwards honored with
the word “<span class="smcap">Nivelle</span>” on their regimental colours, as
a mark of royal approbation of their conduct; and
Lieutenant-Colonel Worsley received a second honorary
distinction.</p>

<p>The passage of the <em>Nive</em> river was effected on the
9th of December; the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were at their
post two hours before daylight&mdash;the stream was nearly
five feet deep, and rapid; a mill stream of equal
depth also opposed the advance; and the mill, with the
village beyond the river, were occupied by the enemy;
but the soldiers moved forward in defiance of all opposition,
forded the streams under a sharp fire of musketry,
and after some fighting, in which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
had one man killed and seven wounded, the
troops established themselves beyond the river; the
French retreating into an intrenched camp in front of
Bayonne.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the battalion took post
on a ridge commanding the communication of the
right wing with the river Nive; this wing was in position
with its right towards the Adour river, and its left
at Ville Franche, and it was not attacked by the enemy
on the 10th, 11th, or 12th of December; but on the
13th a number of French corps assailed the troops
under Sir Rowland Hill with great spirit; when the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> maintained their important post
during the day, with the loss of five men wounded.
The enemy was repulsed with severe loss, and pursued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
to the camp in front of Bayonne: the brigade to which
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> belonged, followed the French
until it arrived within musket shot of the works, and
took post in a ravine, where it remained until night,
when it was relieved by the third division.</p>

<p>The battalion earned another honorary distinction
for its colours on this occasion, and the word “<span class="smcap">Nive</span>”
inscribed thereon by royal authority, commemorates its
gallantry; Lieutenant-Colonel Worsley also received a
third distinction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>Leaving their cantonments at the village of St. Pierre,
near Bayonne, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> advanced, with the
troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Rowland Hill, in
the middle of February, 1814, when the French corps
under General Harispe, were driven from Hellete, and
afterwards forced from a position in front of Garris.
The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> continued to follow the retreating
enemy, and their gallant bearing on the 27th of February,
was afterwards rewarded with the royal authority
to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Orthes</span>” on the regimental colours;
Lieutenant-Colonel Worsley also received the usual
honorary distinction conferred on commanding officers
of battalions distinguishing themselves in action.</p>

<p>Pursuing the retreating enemy in the direction of
Aire, the battalion took part in forcing the French to
quit that town, where immense magazines were captured.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were stationed at Aire
several days, and afterwards took part in forcing the
French back upon <em>Toulouse</em>. Two or three attempts
to throw a bridge of boats across the Garonne were
not attended with success; but the river was eventually
passed, and the enemy driven from his positions on the
10th of April. On this occasion the troops under Sir
Rowland Hill, in whose column the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
served, drove the enemy from his exterior works in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
suburb, on the left of the Garonne, within the ancient
wall. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Worsley, took part in forcing the enemy from his
redoubts, and from the houses which he occupied in
force, and afterwards formed a lodgment in the ditch
surrounding the suburb. The battalion had two men
killed; Captain James H. Baker mortally wounded;
one drummer, and ten rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy having quitted Toulouse, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
moved through the town, and followed the
retiring army some distance; but hostilities were soon
afterwards terminated. Napoleon Bonaparte was
forced to abdicate the imperial throne, and the Bourbon
dynasty was restored to France.</p>

<p>Thus the gallant soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
completed their career of victory and honor; and the
British arms triumphed over the tyrannical power
which had sprung out of the French revolution, and
aimed at universal dominion.</p>

<p>The conquering arms of Britain had rescued nations
from bondage, and restored to Europe the blessings of
peace. The word “<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>” on the colours of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, commemorates the distinguished
part the second battalion took in the achievement of
these splendid results; and its commanding officer,
Lieutenant-Colonel Worsley, was afterwards honored
with the dignity of Companion of the Order of the
Bath.</p>

<p>The first battalion remained at Secunderabad until
the 19th of June, 1814, when it commenced its march
for the island and fortress of Seringapatam, where it
arrived on the 10th of August, and relieved the first
battalion of the Sixty-ninth Regiment.</p>

<p>After reposing in quarters a short time at the city
of Toulouse, the second battalion marched <ins class="corr" id="tn-63" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to Bourdeaux,'">
to Bordeaux,</ins>
where it embarked for Ireland, on the 17th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
July, and landing at Cork, was stationed at Middleton,
Fermoy, &amp;c., until November, when it proceeded to
Dublin, under the command of Major Barlow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>The climate of the garrison of Seringapatam not
proving favourable to the health of the soldiers of the
first battalion, they were moved out of that fortress a
short time, and in August, 1815, commenced their
march for Vellore, where they arrived on the 9th of
October.</p>

<p>The second battalion remained in garrison at Dublin,
until September of this year, when it was suddenly
ordered to march into Tipperary, in consequence of the
insurrectionary proceedings of the inhabitants of that
part of Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>In February, 1816, thirteen officers, and three hundred
and thirty non-commissioned officers and soldiers,
of the first battalion, proceeded from Vellore to the
sea-coast, and were stationed at Cuddalore six months,
for the benefit of their health.</p>

<p>General Sir Eyre Coote was succeeded in the colonelcy
of the regiment by Lieutenant-General the
Honorable Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole, G.C.B., from
the Seventieth Foot, by commission, dated the 21st of
May, 1816.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>The incursions of the barbarous people called <em>Pindarees</em>,
who infested the British territory in India at
this period, and committed dreadful ravages wherever
they appeared, occasioned the first battalion to take the
field early in 1817, when it left a detachment at Vellore,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Worsley, and joined the
division commanded by Major-General Browne, assembled
to guard the passes near Naggerry. In February
the battalion returned to Vellore.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the peace of Europe appearing to
be established upon sound and durable principles, the
second battalion was ordered to be reduced, which took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
place in April, 1817, when the following brigade order
was issued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Major-General Doyle having received the warrant
for the disbandment of the second battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment, and carried the orders of
the commander of the forces into effect, it now only
remains for the major-general to express, in the most
unqualified manner, his perfect approbation of the
sober, orderly, and soldier-like conduct of the corps
in quarters, for a period of upwards of one year
and a half, during which it has been under his immediate
command.</p>

<p>“Major-General Doyle feels it his duty as well as
inclination to mark particularly the zeal and attention
with which Major Barlow has conducted the discipline
of the corps, and in which he has been ably
supported by the officers under his command, and in
case the service should be deprived of so valuable an
officer, the major-general trusts it may be only for a
short time.</p>

<p>“The major-general requests the commanding officer
will convey to the officers, non-commissioned officers,
and privates, his best thanks, and his good wishes for
their individual welfare. He is confident that the
uniform good conduct, for which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
have always been conspicuous, both in the field and
in quarters, will be the same, in whatever part of His
Majesty’s dominions the service of the corps may be
required.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>At this period a confederacy of the native princes
in India was formed against the British authority, and
extensive preparations for war were made by the
coalesced Mahratta States. Their designs were partly
discovered and disconcerted by the governor-general,
the Marquis of Hastings; but hostilities could not be
avoided, and the British took the field for the preservation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of their territory from unjust aggression. On
this occasion the flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>,
mustering eight officers, eight serjeants, six
drummers, and two hundred rank and file, under the
command of Captain Tew, marched from Vellore, to
the frontiers, and joining a division of the army assembling
for field service at Adoni, were formed in a flank
battalion, with the companies of the Sixty-ninth and
Eighty-fourth Regiments. This battalion penetrated
the southern Mahratta country, with the division
under Brigadier-General Munro, to whom the fortresses
of <em>Dummul</em>, <em>Kooshgúl</em>, and <em>Darwar</em> surrendered
in succession; and the division halted during the rainy
season at Darwar, where the flank companies of the
Fifty-third joined the flank battalion, which was commanded
by Major Giles. Leaving Darwar in October,
the division penetrated the Sundoor valley, and afterwards
advanced into the interior of the southern Mahratta
country, Brigadier-General Pritzler commanding.
The division skirmished with the enemy at <em>Bejapoor</em>;
and overtook the rear of the Peishwa’s army at the
<em>Salpée Pass</em>, on the 8th of January, 1818, when the
Mahratta troops fled in every direction, over a difficult
country, which prevented any great loss being inflicted
on them. The division pursued by forced marches,
under a burning sun, until the Peishwa’s army separated,
and passing the flanks, marched to the north.</p>

<p>The battalion companies were relieved from garrison
duty at Vellore, and proceeding to Bangalore, joined a
division of the field force, on the banks of the Toombudra,
under Major-General Long, and remained at this
station during part of the Mahratta and Pindaree war;
but suffering severely from dysentery, they were removed
into garrison at Bellary.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the flank companies had joined part of
the Bombay army; but after the surrender of the hill-fort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of <em>Sattarah</em> they separated from that force, and
again proceeded, with the division under Brigadier-General
Pritzler, to the Salpée Pass, taking part in the
siege and capture of the hill-fort of <em>Singhur</em>, the reduction
of the fortified pagoda and village of <em>Sassoor</em>, the
hill-forts of <em>Uizaghur</em>, and <em>Poorunder</em>, and afterwards
returning through the pass, the operations of the division
were followed by the surrender of a number of
small fortified places. Then proceeding by Sattarah to
the western ghauts and forests, the division captured
the hill-fort of <em>Woossottah</em>, restored the family of Sevajée
to its ancient dignity, and joining the division
under Brigadier-General Munro, took part in the defeat
of a body of hostile troops at <em>Sholapoor</em>, the capture of
the enemy’s artillery, and the reduction of the fortress,
which surrendered on the 15th of May. The flank
companies of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> distinguished themselves
on the 10th of May, and a gallant charge made by
them greatly contributed to the capture of the enemy’s
artillery.</p>

<p>After forcing the fortress of Nepaunee to capitulate,
the division was cantoned, during the remainder of
the year, at Hoobly, where the soldiers suffered from
cholera.</p>

<p>In September the battalion companies left Bellary
for Bangalore, and being attacked by cholera on the
march, lost thirty-seven men in nine days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>Quitting Hoobly in the beginning of 1819, the flank
companies proceeded to Belgaum, and after taking part
in several movements, they were engaged in the siege
of the hill-fort of <em>Copaul Droog</em>, which was invested on
the 10th of May, and captured by assault three days
afterwards, after an obstinate resistance from the
enemy. The following paragraph appeared in general
orders, dated Madras, 22nd June, 1819.</p>

<p>“The conduct of three troops of His Majesty’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Twenty-second Light Dragoons, with the Artillery
troop under Captain Mills, and the flank battalion
commanded by Captain <span class="smcap">Tew</span>, of His Majesty’s
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment, employed during the
siege of <span class="smcap">Capaul Droog</span>, was such as to draw from
me, (Brigadier-General Pritzler), the highest encomiums,
particularly that of the Artillery troops of the
Twenty-second Dragoons, which served in the batteries,
and the flank battalion which protected the
batteries, and led the assault of the place, in which
the services of Captains <span class="smcap">Tew</span>, <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>;
Cuppaidge, Fifty-third; Jenour and Jones, Sixty-ninth
Regiment; and Lieutenant Silver, Fifty-third,
were most conspicuous.”</p>

<p>The flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> were
again stationed at Belgaum, until October, when they
marched, with a small native force, against <em>Sanglee</em>,
which place they forced to submit, and afterwards
returned to Belgaum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>On the 25th of May, 1820, the head-quarters and
battalion companies of the regiment marched from
Bangalore, on route for Madras, where they arrived
on the 2nd of July, and were joined by the flank companies
from Belgaum on the 29th of December. These
companies had been absent three years and eight
months, and had lost one subaltern and eighty-one rank
and file. On the breaking up of the flank battalion, it
was stated in orders,&mdash;</p>

<p>“From the period of the battalion joining the
force to the present Colonel Pritzler has, in no
instance, had the slightest cause of complaint, and
has never had occasion to bring a non-commissioned
officer or private to a court-martial; but he has had
frequent opportunities of bearing testimony of the
excellent conduct of this corps, which has been
equally conspicuous for its gallantry in the field, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
for its order and regularity in camp, and which he
attributes to the unwearied attention of Major Giles,
and the officers under his command, and to the excellent
disposition and discipline of the non-commissioned
officers and soldiers. Colonel Pritzler cannot
therefore, but regret the departure of the corps from
under his command.</p>

<p>“It has frequently fallen to Captain <span class="smcap">Tew</span> to command
the battalion, in the absence of Major Giles on
other duties, which gave him an opportunity of
showing that he was, in every way, competent to fill
the situation, with great credit to himself and advantage
to His Majesty’s service.”</p>

<p>The conduct of the battalion was also commended
in general orders, by Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas
Hislop, Bart., G.C.B.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>On the departure of the regiment from Madras, for
Wallajabad, in 1821, when arrangements were in progress
for its return to England, it was stated in general
orders,&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Honorable the Governor cannot permit His
Majesty’s <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment to quit the
garrison without expressing his entire approbation of
the discipline and exemplary conduct manifested, on
all occasions, by the officers, non-commissioned officers,
and soldiers of that corps, ever since its arrival
at Fort St. George, now a period of nearly two years,
and his Excellency requests Lieutenant-Colonel Dickens,
and the officers under his command, to accept
his best thanks for the very satisfactory manner in
which they have performed their respective duties.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822<br />1823</div>

<p>During the year 1822 the regiment was stationed at
Wallajabad; and in January, 1823, it returned to
Madras, preparatory to its embarkation for England.
The prompt and active exertions of the corps on the
breaking out of a fire in the Company’s stores, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
7th of January, preserved property to a considerable
amount.</p>

<p>Five hundred and thirty-seven non-commissioned
officers and soldiers having volunteered to remain in
India, and transfer their services to other corps, the
remainder of the regiment, amounting to one hundred
and sixteen officers and soldiers, embarked on board the
Company’s ship “Coldstream,” on the 9th of March,
and sailed for England under Lieutenant-Colonel
Dickens. The regiment called at St. Helena, where it
remained about a week, and arrived in the river Thames,
in the early part of July, after an absence from England
of upwards of twenty-three years, landed at Gravesend,
from whence it marched to Chatham, where the establishment
was fixed at six hundred and fifty officers
and soldiers.</p>

<p>The depôt joined from Portsmouth on the 19th of
July; recruiting parties were sent to various towns in
the United Kingdom: and in December the regiment
marched to Windsor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>After remaining two months at Windsor the regiment
proceeded to Portsmouth, where it embarked for
Ireland in May, 1824, and landing at Dublin, marched
to Enniskillen, sending detachments to Maguires-bridge,
Cavan, Killishandra, Kings-court, and Bally
James Duff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>In the summer of 1825 the regiment proceeded to
Boyle, and furnished nine detachments to stations in
that part of the country; in August the head-quarters
were removed to Longford, and in October to Athlone.
At this period the establishment was augmented to
eight hundred and thirty-six officers and soldiers, and
the regiment was divided into six service and four
depôt companies: but the service companies did not
proceed abroad at this period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>From Athlone the regiment marched to Dublin, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
May, 1826; and furnished a detachment of grenadiers
to Hacketstown, to mount guard at the residence of the
Lord-Lieutenant, during his stay in that part of the
country.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General the Honorable Sir G. Lowry
Cole, G.C.B., was removed to the Twenty-seventh, or
the Inniskilling Regiment, of Foot, and was succeeded
in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, by Lieutenant-General
Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, Bart,
G.C.B., G.C.H., by commission, dated the 16th of
December, 1826.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827<br />1828</div>

<p>After remaining twelve months at Dublin, the head-quarters
were removed to Templemore, in May, 1827,
and in September to Galway, furnishing twelve detachments
to military stations in that neighbourhood. In
April, 1828, the regiment was removed to Buttevant;
and in July to Cork.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>During the six years which had elapsed from the date
of the arrival of the regiment from India, it had recruited
its ranks and attained a state of discipline and efficiency,
and its turn to proceed abroad having arrived in
August, 1829, the service companies embarked from
Cork for North America; they sailed in two divisions,
the first under Major the Honorable H. S. Fane, and
the second under Captain Tew, and arriving at Nova
Scotia in October, landed at Halifax, where they remained
nine months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>In July, 1830, the head-quarters were removed
from Halifax to Fort Charlotte, and detachments were
sent to Prince Edward’s Island, Annapolis, Windsor,
York Redoubt, Sydney, Cape Breton, and St. Andrews,
New Brunswick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>The regiment remained detached until August,
1832, when the head-quarters, consisting of one field
officer, two captains, five subalterns, two staff, twenty-three
serjeants, nine drummers, and three hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
sixty-seven rank and file, embarked on board His
Majesty’s ship “Winchester” for New Brunswick, disembarked
at St. John’s, and proceeded to Fredericton,
having left at the former station one field officer, one
captain, two subalterns, six serjeants, one drummer, and
a hundred and seven rank and file, which followed
them on the 1st of September, in His Majesty’s brig
“Arachne,” and arrived at St. John’s, New Brunswick,
on the 4th September, 1832.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<p>In 1834, on retiring from the command of the regiment,
Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Kelly presented to
the officers’ mess, a handsome snuff-box.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Kelly was succeeded in the
command of the regiment by Lieutenant-Colonel the
Honorable Henry Fane.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835</div>

<p>The regiment remained in New Brunswick until
July, 1835, when it returned in two divisions to
Halifax.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1836</div>

<p>In May, 1836, detachments were sent to Cape
Breton, Annapolis, York Redoubt, and Prince Edward’s
Island.</p>

<p>In this year, the red and white tuft, which had
been previously worn by the battalion companies, was
allowed by the following letter to be resumed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>The two flank companies, consisting of two captains,
two subalterns, eight serjeants, two drummers,
and one hundred and fifty rank and file, marched, under
Captain Byron, for New Brunswick, 19th December,
1837.</p>

<p>On the 24th and 25th of December, they marched
from St. John’s, New Brunswick, for Quebec, Lower
Canada; they were conveyed on the ice of the St. John
river, to the junction of the river Madawaska with the
St. John, then up the river to the head of the Timiscouta
Lake, in two-horse sleighs, each sleigh carrying
eight men, with their arms and accoutrements: from
the head of the Lake Timiscouta, they were conveyed
in carioles, two men with their arms, &amp;c., in each,
across the Portage to the river St. Lawrence, and on
reaching the village of St. André, they followed the
course of the river to Point Levi, opposite Quebec,
where they crossed in canoes, having suffered little
from the severity of the weather, and the inhabitants
aiding their progress in every way. The few
men left at different places sick, were treated with
every kindness, and were all sufficiently recovered to
proceed with the head-quarters on their marching
up, except two men left at Fredericton, but whose
complaints were quite unconnected with the exposure
of the march.</p>

<p>On the regiment being ordered to proceed to
Canada, the following general order was issued by his
Excellency Major-General Sir Colin Campbell, K.C.B.,
&amp;c., Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“The Major-General commanding cannot allow the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment to quit the command,
without expressing his perfect satisfaction with the
discipline and regularity with which the corps has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
uniformly conducted itself; and his Excellency
desires that Major Ruxton will convey to the officers
and soldiers, under his command, his best wishes for
their future welfare, assured as he is, that in whatever
service the corps may be employed, they will
continue to display those qualities which have
secured to them so high a character as soldiers.</p>

<p class="right">“<em>A. D. A. General</em>.”</p>
</div>

<p>This year the regiment lost a valuable officer,
<span class="smcap">Major Mark McLeod Tew</span>, whose many excellent
qualities occasioned him to be highly esteemed by the
officers and soldiers of his corps. He entered the
regiment as ensign in 1800, was promoted lieutenant in
the same year, captain in 1809, major by brevet in
1830, and major in the regiment in 1837. His distinguished
services with the flank battalion, during the
Mahratta and Pindaree war, from 1817 to 1820, are set
forth in the record of his regiment. The state of his
health occasioned him to retire from the service in
August, 1837; but his decease occurred in October, at
Halifax, Nova Scotia, before he could embark for
England.</p>

<p>In transmitting to his brother, Captain J. McLeod
Tew, Twenty-second Regiment, an account of his
effects, &amp;c., Captain E. Broderick expressed himself in
the following affectionate terms:&mdash;“One of the snuff-boxes
found among his effects, has been retained by
the officers, as a memento of him who had been so
long the father of the regiment, and who was so
deservedly loved and respected by us all: it is a
wooden box, presented to him by Mr. Markham,
which the officers intend to place in a case, with a
suitable inscription.</p>

<p>“The officers intend to erect a monument to our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
respected friend, to be placed in one of the churches.
The men of the regiment have also subscribed to the
erection of this monument, and I can assure you,
that every officer and soldier feels that in your late
brother he has lost a friend.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>On the 8th January, 1838, the head-quarters, and
remaining four companies, consisting of one field officer,
three captains, four subalterns, three staff, twenty-two
serjeants, eight drummers, and two hundred and
eighty-one rank and file, under Major Ruxton, embarked
in Her Majesty’s ship “Cornwallis,” and sailed
the following day for St. John’s, New Brunswick, where
they landed on the 14th of the same month.</p>

<p>The regiment marched from St. John’s for Quebec
by companies, which were conveyed in the same manner
as the flank companies had been, and were equally
fortunate in escaping without casualties of any importance;
they reached Quebec on the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and
7th February.</p>

<p>The flank companies and Nos. 1 and 2, were detached
to Three Rivers: they took part in various
movements made in the disturbed districts, adjoining
the river Richelieu; and were quartered in different
villages in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The regiment next moved by detachments to Montreal.
The head-quarters then proceeded to Kingston,
but were not disembarked there, proceeding on to
Toronto, where they arrived on the 4th of June. In
July the head-quarters, under Lieutenant-Colonel Airey,
proceeded to Amherstberg.</p>

<p>In December a company, consisting of one captain,
two subalterns, three serjeants, and fifty rank and file,
under Captain Broderick, proceeded to Sandwich, in
expectation of that place being attacked by brigands
from the state of Michigan, from whence it returned
on the 25th of that month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Amherstburg until May,
1840, when it returned in three divisions to Toronto,
detaching three companies to Kingston, at which station
it remained until May, 1841, when the head-quarters
moved to Montreal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>On the 31st May, 1841, orders having been received
for the return of the regiment to England, four
serjeants, nine corporals, two drummers, and two hundred
and one privates, volunteered to serve permanently
in North America.</p>

<p>At Montreal, the head-quarters were joined by the
left wing on the 3rd June, 1841, and on the 20th of
that month the regiment, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Airey, sailed from Quebec in the
“Cornwall” transport for England, where it arrived
on the 22nd July, 1841, and landed at Gosport and
occupied Forton Barracks. In September, the head-quarters
moved over to Portsmouth, where they remained
until August, 1842, during which time the
efficiency of the regiment, which had been impaired, to
a certain degree, by the number of recruits which had
taken the place of those who had volunteered to remain
in Canada, was completely restored.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>On the 13th August, 1842, the regiment received a
sudden order at half-past seven o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, to proceed
to London by an early train the following morning.
Accordingly, on the 14th of August, the head-quarters,
consisting of one lieutenant-colonel, one major, nine
captains, ten subalterns, three staff, twenty-seven serjeants,
eleven drummers, and five hundred and twenty-four
rank and file, left Portsmouth at eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and
proceeding by the South Western Railway to London,
arrived at the Nine Elms Station, marched to the
Birmingham Railway Station, and proceeded forthwith
to Weedon, where it arrived at twelve at night; sudden
disturbances in the manufacturing districts were the
cause of this unexpected movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>On the 16th August, three companies left Weedon
for the disturbed districts, and on the 17th two more
companies proceeded in the same direction. These
were detached at Newcastle-under-Lyme, Wolverhampton,
and Stafford; other companies were detached to
Birmingham, and during the autumn of 1842, the head-quarters
were moved to Northampton, all the ten
companies being on detachment at Newcastle-under-Lyme,
Burslem, Hanley, Stafford, Wolverhampton,
Bilston, Birmingham, and Coventry.</p>

<p>The companies were subsequently withdrawn from
Bilston and Stafford; but the others remained as
above described until the 4th August, when the
entire regiment was collected together at Weedon.
At this period the strength of the regiment was as
follows, viz:&mdash;One colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, two
majors, ten captains, twelve lieutenants, eight ensigns,
one paymaster, one adjutant, one quartermaster, one
surgeon, one assistant-surgeon, forty-seven serjeants,
fourteen drummers, and eight hundred and one rank
and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843</div>

<p>During the year 1843, political agitation was carried
to such an extent in Ireland, as to induce Her Majesty’s
Government to take measures for putting down the
demonstrations of physical force which had been made
in that country.</p>

<p>For this purpose, additional corps were ordered
from Great Britain to Ireland. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment, on this emergency, was ordered on the 4th
of October to be removed by railroad to Liverpool.
The regiment quitted its station at Weedon early in the
morning of the 6th of October, and arrived at Liverpool
on the same day. It was embarked on the afternoon of
the 7th of October in steam-vessels for Dublin, where
it arrived on the following morning, and being disembarked,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
it marched to Clontarf<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> (a village situated
about two miles from the capital, on the Bay of Dublin),
where a numerous public meeting had been advertised
to be held, but which was prohibited by Government
proclamation as illegal. A large body of troops had
been concentrated in the neighbourhood in apprehension
of a breach of the peace; but the assemblage
having separated without disturbance, the troops returned
to their quarters in the evening.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1844</div>

<p>The regiment remains in Dublin at the period to
which this record is brought.</p>


<p class="p2">The foregoing pages record the bravery, endurance,
and uniformly good conduct of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>
Regiment, both at home and abroad: its early services
during the wars in Spain and Flanders in the reign of
Queen Anne; its subsequent achievements on various
expeditions in Europe, Africa, America, and the West
Indies; its employment, for a period exceeding twenty
years, in the East Indies; and its gallantry in Portugal,
Spain, and France, to the conclusion of the Peninsular
War in 1814, afford the best proofs of the zealous and
honorable conduct of its officers and men, who, under
severe trials, have evinced a steady adherence to the
rules of discipline, and a gallant bearing whenever they
have been brought into contact with the enemies of their
country: nor has the conduct of the regiment been less
conspicuous on home, than on foreign, service; but has
been, at all times, such as to merit the approbation of
the Sovereign, and the gratitude of the kingdom.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 12th February, 1702.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Lord Lucas</span> was distinguished for his attachment
to the interests of civil and religious liberty; and at the
revolution in 1688, when King James II. had fled in disguise,
and London was in great confusion, his Lordship was
nominated, by a committee assembled for the preservation of
tranquillity, to take the charge of the Tower. This appointment
was confirmed to Lord Lucas by King William III.,
who gave his Lordship a commission of Governor of the
Tower of London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lucas</span> entered the army, and served under King
William in Flanders; and he was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy
of the Thirteenth Regiment, commanded by Sir
John Jacobs. On the breaking out of the war of the Spanish
succession, his Lordship took great interest in raising a regiment
of foot, now the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, of which he was appointed
colonel by King William, in February, 1702.</p>

<p>Queen Anne superseded his Lordship’s commission as
Governor of the Tower, and appointed the Earl of Abingdon
to that dignity, with the title of Constable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lucas</span> retained the colonelcy of his regiment until
his decease, on the 31st of January, 1705; when the dignity

<p><span class="smcap">Hans Hamilton</span> served in the wars of King William

officer: he was afterwards nominated to the lieutenant-colonelcy
of the Earl of Derby’s Regiment, now Sixteenth Foot,
with which corps he proceeded to the Netherlands in the
summer of 1701. He served under the celebrated <span class="smcap">John
Duke of Marlborough</span>, during the campaigns of 1702 and
1703, in the Netherlands, and also in Germany in 1704,
when the victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim exalted the
reputation of the British arms. In February, 1705, he was
rewarded with the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>; and in
the same year he was nominated quartermaster-general to
the expedition to Spain, under General the Earl of Peterborough,
and he served at the capture of Barcelona; also in
other important transactions until 1706. He subsequently
proceeded to Flanders, and having been promoted to the rank
of brigadier-general in 1710, he commanded a brigade, under
the Duke of Marlborough, during the campaign of 1711,
when the enemy’s celebrated lines were passed at Arleux,
and the fortress of Bouchain was besieged and captured. In
1713 he was removed to the Sixteenth Regiment, with
which corps his early services were connected: and in 1715
he was succeeded by Richard Viscount Irwing. He died on
the 24th of October, 1721.</p>

of brigadier-general. On the breaking out of the rebellion
in Scotland, he returned to England with a brigade of infantry,
and afterwards took the charge of two battalions
which had arrived from Ireland, with which he joined the
army under Field-Marshal Wade. On the flight of the
rebels from Derby, he was detached to Scotland; and he
commanded a brigade of infantry at the battle of Falkirk, on
the 17th of January, 1746, when he highly distinguished
himself; but the excessive fatigue he underwent, with continued
exposure to severe weather, deprived him of the use
of his limbs for some time. In 1747, he was promoted to the
rank of major-general; and he was removed in 1749, to the
Twelfth Dragoons. He was again removed, in November of

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 25th June, 1810.</em></p>

<p>This officer was appointed ensign in the Thirty-seventh
Regiment on the 15th of April, 1774, and proceeding to
North America at the commencement of the American war,
he had repeated opportunities of distinguishing himself. He
served at the capture of Long Island, and carried the regimental
colour of his corps at the battle of Brooklyn, on the
27th of August, 1776. He also served at the capture of
New York, and at the reduction of Fort Washington, and
subsequently accompanied the expedition to Rhode Island;
in the same year he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant.
He proceeded with the expedition to Pennsylvania, and
served at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown, in
1777, and of Monmouth in 1778; also at the reduction of
Mud Island. On the 10th of August, 1778, he was promoted
to captain of a company in his regiment, in which
rank he was present at the attack of Washington’s dragoons,
in New Jersey. He proceeded with the expedition to South
Carolina, and served at the siege of Charlestown, in 1780.

of the campaign, under Major-General Earl Cornwallis, in
the Carolinas and in Virginia, and was made prisoner at the
surrender of York Town, on the 18th of October, 1781. On

1793 he was selected to command the first battalion of light
infantry, in the expedition to the West Indies, under General
Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey, who captured the
islands of Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadaloupe. Lieutenant-Colonel
Coote had opportunities of distinguishing himself at
the reduction of these colonies, and being afterwards sent to
England with despatches, he was nominated aide-de-camp to
King George III., with the rank of colonel, in 1795. In 1796
he was appointed brigadier-general on the staff of Ireland;
in 1798 he was promoted to the rank of major-general, and
removed to the staff of South Britain; and after commanding
at Dover a short period, he proceeded to Flanders, in charge
of an expedition for the destruction of the sluices and works
of the canal near Ostend, which was accomplished; but before
the troops could re-embark, they were attacked by superior
numbers, and forced to surrender. Major-General Coote was
wounded on this occasion. After his exchange, he returned
to his command at Dover. In 1799 he commanded a brigade
in the expedition to Holland, under his Royal Highness the
Duke of York; and after the return of the army, he resumed
the command of the troops at Dover. In 1800 he proceeded
with the expedition against Ferrol, and when the attack on
that fortress was relinquished, he joined the armament in the
Mediterranean, and accompanied General Sir Ralph Abercromby
to Egypt. He commanded the leading division of
the army which effected a landing in the Bay of Aboukir, on
the 8th of March, 1801, and distinguished himself on that
occasion, for which he was thanked, in orders, by Sir Ralph
Abercromby. He commanded a brigade in the actions before
Alexandria, and when the advance to Cairo was undertaken,
he was left in command of the troops before Alexandria.
After taking a distinguished part in delivering Egypt from
the power of France, he returned to England, where he
received the thanks of both houses of parliament, the approbation
of his Sovereign, and was honored with the dignity
of Knight of the Bath, and the first class of the Turkish
Order of the Crescent.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1 pfs70">AT DUBLIN,</p>

<p class="pfs90">ON THE 21st OF JUNE, 1844.</p>

<hr class="r30" />

<p><span class="smcap">General Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane</span>, Bart., G.C.B.
and G.C.H., having arrived in Dublin from his seat, Makerstoun,
near Kelso, reviewed this regiment (of which he is
Colonel) in Richmond Barracks. After having received the
general salute, he proceeded down the line, making a most
minute inspection, and marking out and questioning every old
soldier in the corps. The regiment then went through various
movements, and concluded by forming square, when the General
addressed the men in a most soldier-like and impressive manner,
stating, that through a very long period of service, it had been
his duty to inspect many Corps, and that he could safely aver
that he had never seen one in better order, or in a higher state
of discipline, than the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>. He adverted to the
importance of sobriety, and the advantages of education, as the
means of any one belonging to the regiment attaining the rank
which he himself held, instances of which, the General observed,
were afforded by the British Army. He concluded by expressing
his wish, that in order to commemorate his visit to the
regiment, all prisoners, not under sentence of Courts Martial,
might be allowed to return to their duty without further punishment.</p>

<p>Upon the regiment being dismissed, the men proceeded to
their Barrack-room, where a most excellent dinner, including
everything except spirits, had been prepared, at the expense of
Sir Thomas Brisbane, for the whole of the non-commissioned
officers, privates, women, and children, in the corps. During
the repast the messes were visited by the General in person
It is needless to observe, he was received with the most marked
enthusiasm. He afterwards saw the Hospital, and the Boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
and Girls’ School, with which he expressed himself much
pleased.</p>

<p>General Sir Thomas M. Brisbane, during his stay in Dublin,
attended several of the garrison field-days, consisting of three
regiments of cavalry, five regiments of infantry, and two troops
of horse artillery. The gallant General, as well as the Lord
Lieutenant, and Sir Edward Blakeney, the Commander-in-Chief,
who were present, expressed their warmest satisfaction at the
manner in which the troops performed their various movements.
The fine appearance of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> in particular was
highly extolled. On one of these occasions, General Sir Thomas
Brisbane, at the express desire of Sir Edward Blakeney, had the
honour to receive a salute from the whole of the troops under
arms.</p>

<p>The following is the effective strength of the regiment:&mdash;Head-Quarters,
Dublin, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Airey. Total Effectives,&mdash;1 Lieutenant-Colonel, 1
Major, 10 Captains, 10 Lieutenants, 7 Ensigns, 5 Staff, 47
Serjeants, 14 Drummers, 788 rank and file.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1 pfs70">TO THE</p>

<p class="p1 pfs90">OFFICERS OF THE THIRTY-FOURTH REGIMENT,</p>

<p class="p1 pfs70">AT DUBLIN.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="smcap">General Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane</span>, Bart., gave
a magnificent entertainment at Morrisson’s Hotel, Dublin, on
Tuesday evening, the 25th June, 1844, to the Officers of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment, of which corps the gallant General
is Colonel. Every delicacy in season, and every variety of the
choicest wines were supplied in profusion. The distinguished
entertainer, and his guests, were pleased to express themselves
in the highest terms of the entire arrangements made by
Mr. Baker for the occasion. The fine band of the regiment
played during the evening some of the newest and most admired
pieces of music.</p>

<p>After the health of Her Majesty had been drunk,</p>

<p>Sir Thomas gave the health of Colonel Airey and the Officers
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment. In introducing the
toast, the gallant General spoke nearly as follows:&mdash;Colonel
Airey and Officers of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment,&mdash;I beg
most unfeignedly to assure you, that this is a most gratifying
occasion to me; and I have looked forward to it with the
greatest pleasure. Ever since the regiment returned from foreign
service, I have been most anxious to meet with the Officers of
so gallant a corps, which has distinguished itself on every occasion,
and in various quarters of the globe; although I never
had the good fortune to have the regiment immediately under my
command, yet I have fought with it in many of the same battles.
Even as far back as 1796, I fought with it at the capture of the
island of St. Lucia. I also served with it in the Peninsula, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
in all the battles which they proudly bear upon their colours,
with the exception of Albuhera. We fought together at Vittoria,
the Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, and Orthes; and I consider that
the regiment ought to have had Toulouse added to the others,
and I regret that the high authorities decided otherwise. But
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment occupied a most important situation
during that action, of which I was an eye-witness, being
the nearest division to that of Lord Hill’s; and the returns of
the killed and wounded on these various occasions, amounting
to nearly 1800 men, proclaim that the regiment had borne the
brunt of many a severe and hard-fought battle. I assure you,
gentlemen, it is a source of great gratification to me that I have
been enabled to record all these gallant deeds, and more particularly
that of Arroya de Molinos. In that brilliant affair the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> Regiment took the French Thirty-fourth Regiment
prisoners, together with its brass drum, and Drum-Major’s
Staff, &amp;c.; and in consequence, the gallant corps to which you
belong is permitted to enjoy a distinction that has fallen to the
lot of no other regiment&mdash;that of wearing the white and red
tufts in their caps. But this and the other heroic deeds will
be imperishably recorded in the History of the Regiment, a
copy of which I intend to present to every Officer, and also
some copies to the library, that when any officer or soldier joins
the regiment, he may, on reading all these gallant exploits, be
animated with the desire of upholding that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
which has happily ever subsisted in the regiment, and which I
hope will ever continue. I cannot here omit to notice how
much we are indebted to Mr. Cannon, of the Adjutant-General’s
Office, for the pains and labour he has bestowed, to enable us to
print these records, and to give a faithful detail of all our early
operations, deduced from the most authentic sources. Next to
the bravery before the enemy, I admire the conduct which has
marked the regiment, wherever it has been quartered; and it is
with a feeling of pride I say, that in every place in which it has
been, both Officers and men have left with the high opinion of
the inhabitants. Gentlemen, I assure you this visit associates
itself with many remote and pleasing recollections, as I consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
myself one of the few connecting links left which unite the
army of the last century with that of the present; and I am
happy to think, in drawing a parallel betwixt the two, the contrast
is all in favour of the latter. In the first place, we are
now a much more scientific army; next, we are an infinitely
better educated body, and much more sober, as relates both to
Officers and soldiers; and thirdly, as to our movements,&mdash;When
I first joined the army, there was no officer to be found in a
regiment who could give a sketch of a country, or delineate a
position; now, in consequence of the establishment at Sandhurst,
there are few regiments without several of the officers
who are qualified, not only to give a sketch of a country, or
delineate a position, but to construct field-works, or to undertake
the siege if necessary. With regard to education, it was then
difficult to find even a serjeant who could read and write, or
keep accounts; whereas, now, almost every soldier in a regiment
is so far educated, and there are 700 out of the 800 men of
which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span> is composed, who can read and write.
The period that I allude to was when I was quartered in this
city, in 1792 and a part of 1793. Dundas’s system was then
introduced into the service. Before that time no uniformity
existed in our military movements, nor even in the words
of command; for if an officer was sent from one regiment to
another, he would not have understood them, since regiments
moved according to the fancy of their respective commanding
officers. Now, as the <span class="smcap">Thirty-fourth</span>, about the time I am
speaking of, had been long in America, its movements were principally
those of light troops; and a favourite one was that of
moving from the centre and flanks of companies by files. I
have had the advantage of serving in the first and second campaigns
of the war with the Austrian and Prussian armies; and
I may say I have seen almost the whole of the European armies
in motion upon a large scale; and I consider that the British,
in point of quickness and accuracy, stands foremost; and nobody
will doubt that their physical strength and moral courage are
superior to that of any other nation. It is all one to the British
soldier where his enemy may be,&mdash;whether in his front, flanks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
or rear,&mdash;he will fight him as long as his officer orders him, as at
Waterloo, where whole faces of the squares were swept away
with round shot, still the British soldier was found immovable.
And although you may characterise the British soldier as the
lion in the field, yet the most noble of all his traits, according to
my estimation, is his humanity after a battle, when the lion
suddenly changes to the lamb; and I never saw an instance in
all my service in which the British soldier committed an act of
cruelty upon his fallen enemy<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Next to the British soldier, I
consider the Russian the most formidable while placed in position,
although he cannot move<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; and I may instance the fact in
support of this, that at the battle of Borodino, the redoubts were
five times taken by the French, and as often retaken by the
Russians. Napoleon, finding he could make no impression on
their iron front, made a flank movement with his army during
the night, and got betwixt them and Moscow. It is too much
the idea amongst the continental armies, that if their centre is
pierced, or their flanks are turned, the battle is lost, as at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
unfortunate battle of Jena, which the Prussians lost, and which
decided the fate of their country. The same may be said with
regard to the Austrians, at the battles of Wagram and Asperne,
which led to the occupation of Vienna by the French, and to
peace. How widely different with the British soldier! While
in Paris, in the year 1815, I had many conversations with
French officers of high rank, who argued strongly, that by all
the laws of war, the English had lost the Battle of Waterloo, as
their centre had been pierced, their flanks turned, and their
artillery were in possession of the French. Could these gentlemen
have possibly paid a higher compliment to the British
army, although they wished to turn that compliment to their own
account. When Napoleon saw the English army drawn up in
position for the Battle of Waterloo, he remarked to Marshal
Soult, “There are the English, I have got them at last, and I
think it is nine chances out of ten that I have them all before
night.” The Marshal, who had had a great deal of experience
of the English, while opposed to them in Spain and in the South
of France, replied to the Emperor, “Your Majesty certainly sees
the English army, but you will find them like trees, rivetted to
the ground.” I may here mention, in confirmation of this, that
when the Kremlin was re-occupied by the Russians, the portfolio
of Berthier, the War Minister, was found, giving a return
of the French army in Russia, amounting to 400,000 infantry,
and 80,000 cavalry. There were also found secret reports from
the French Marshals opposed to the English in Spain, and addressed
to Napoleon himself, stating that the French army could
not be got to withstand the English when they came in close
quarters! I have been long anxious to get the regiment to come
to Scotland, that I might have an opportunity of uniting the
bond of friendship and good understanding with myself and with
the Officers more closely, and particularly as it is now ninety-eight
years since it was in that country. In the year 1746, the
regiment fought at the Battle of Culloden, and by a singular and
rather extraordinary coincidence, my father fought with it in
that action as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aide-de-Camp</i> to the Earl of Home. I felt exceedingly
gratified in examining into the interior economy of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
regiment, to find that it is perfect and complete, both as to barracks,
hospitals, and school; and I regret that my right honourable
friend, Sir Edward Blakeney, the Commander-in-Chief, is
not here to receive the report, as also in reference to its movements
in the field: It is impossible for me to express too high
an opinion of Colonel Airey, and the hearty co-operation he
must have received from his officers to have enabled him to
have brought the regiment to its present state of perfection;
he could only have accomplished it by establishing a chain of
responsibility throughout all ranks, where every individual discharged
his proper duty, and to which we may ascribe <ins class="corr" id="tn-100" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the the brilliant'">
the brilliant</ins> victories we always obtained under our great and
invincible leader, who strictly enforced this amongst all ranks of
his army, and which enabled him to declare to me his conviction,
after the battle of Toulouse, when the army was about to
be broken up, that he had commanded the most perfect army
that ever was in existence. In conclusion, I fear I have occupied
a good deal of your time, but I was anxious that you should
hear many of these important military facts, from an individual
who has passed above fifty years in the service, and who, in
following up his profession, has crossed the tropics twelve times,
the equinoxial line twice, and circumnavigated the globe, besides
having been in America and other parts of the world.</p>

<p>Colonel Airey, in reply to the toast, took occasion to remark,
that it was owing entirely to the hearty co-operation and assistance
he had derived from every officer in the regiment, he had
been enabled to bring it to the state of perfection in which the
gallant General, who was then Colonel, had found it.</p>

<p>Many other toasts were afterwards given, and the meeting
broke up at a late hour, but not before health and long life to
Sir Thomas <ins class="corr" id="tn-100a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'had been drank'">

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> There is no parallel in history of an army like the English marching
through the South of France, then an enemy’s country, observing
such rigid discipline and order that everything was paid for <ins class="corr" id="tn-98" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'as scruulously as'">
as scrupulously as</ins> if it had been in England; and that even the French officers
and soldiers told the inhabitants not to quit their houses on the absence
of the English army, as they had nothing to fear. I may be induced to
make this remark, as none of the authors who have written on these
campaigns have sufficiently dwelt on this important feature of the
British army. It is a fact, that commissaries were left behind to pay
for every article consumed by our army.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> In confirmation of this it may be mentioned, that when the late
Emperor Alexander of Russia gave a grand review to the Duke of
Wellington, at Vertus, about eighty miles from Paris, of 130,000 Russians,
picquets were driven into the ground at every wheeling point.
How widely different are the movements of the British army! Some
time afterwards, when the whole army under the command of his Grace
were reviewed in presence of the allied Sovereigns, Field-Marshals, and
Commanders, he moved the whole of his forces from the position they
had taken, to nearly a quarter of a mile in the rear, no doubt with the
view of showing that there were no picquets driven into the ground to
direct the movements of the troops.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
